The current model   PrecisionHawk UAV  called  Lancaster Mark III.  PrecisionHawkâ€™ unmanned aircraft system   , robotic plane   collect extremely -resolution, remote sensing data  minimal effort. The aircraft   lightweight (1.3 kilograms),  (  1 meter  nose  tail), silent (runs  brushless electric motors)   designed   extremely easy  . The aircraft automatically computes flight paths, survey parameters, -  landing paths,     vital . Once  survey  complete,  -board computers  automatically connect  Wi-Fi networks  transfer  remote sensing data, flight   diagnostics  remote servers. Users   required  manually generate  plot mission paths  build flight plans based   weather conditions. Instead,  aircraft  automatically adapt   current conditions.
