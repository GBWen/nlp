TM2 (TM Squared)  materials company formed  2005  develop carbon/metal materials called covetics (named  2010).  The  patent issued  USPTO January 2013,  additional patents issued  2013   patent-pending.  The patents  materials    class  materials called covetics,  carbon   nano-scale  infused  bonded  base metals   alloys   single phase    separated  -melting.  The nanocarbon bonding  tailoring   finished covetic  adjusting carbon content  post processing  enhance  properties   base metal   conductivities, durability,  corrosion resistance.  The  $5M investment  TM2    secure composition  matter patents,  develop production procedures  robotics  repeatable control,  setup  studio/ lab ( Dayton, OH),   develop  understanding   covetic bond   properties  covetics ( peer-reviewed paper submitted November 2013  University  Maryland  Academic Research License  TM2).  Market    performed  numerous industries   traditional metals segments  copper, silver, gold  aluminum    analysis   nanocarbon markets concentrating  graphene, CNTs   carbon allotropes.  Covetics      sp2  sp3 nanocarbon structures  graphene- nanoribbons,  enhance  properties   base metal.  Enhanced properties  covetics,   developed,  replace metals   applications.  Silver covetics,  instance,   easy   , casts  finer  geometry, hardens  pure silver  alloying  resists tarnish   fine silver.  Copper covetics  carry   current density,   tensile strength  resists corrosion   pure copper.  Capital  acquire production equipment  apply covetics  specific products   raised.
