"PrecisionHawk is an information delivery company that combines unmanned aerial systems, cutting-edge artificial intelligence and remote sensing technologies to improve business operations and day-to-day decision making. Founded in 2010, PrecisionHawk brings value to an emerging market by offering an end-to-end solution for aerial data gathering, processing and analysis to provide actionable information across a wide range of data-intensive civilian industries. 

The current model of the PrecisionHawk UAV is called the Lancaster Mark III.  PrecisionHawk’s unmanned aircraft system is a small, robotic plane that can collect extremely high-resolution, remote sensing data with minimal effort. The aircraft itself is lightweight (1.3 kilograms), small (less than 1 meter from nose to tail), silent (runs on brushless electric motors) and is designed to be extremely easy to use. The aircraft automatically computes flight paths, survey parameters, take-off and landing paths, as well as other vital information. Once the survey is complete, the on-board computers will automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks and transfer all remote sensing data, flight information and diagnostics to remote servers. Users are never required to manually generate or plot mission paths or build flight plans based off of weather conditions. Instead, the aircraft will automatically adapt to its current conditions.

The artificial intelligence that operates all elements of the UAV, including the aerial and data decisions throughout the PrecisionHawk system, is the core reason behind PrecisionHawk’s ability to secure sub 1 cm per pixel imagery, a market-leading aerial resolution. The Artificial Intelligence approach also eliminates the need for a technical operator.  In addition, the aircraft is equipped with advanced diagnostic capabilities, enabling it to monitor all facets of the mission from power consumption to airframe fatigue to survey quality. The Lancaster MK III operates at altitudes below that of manned aviation. This reduces the burden of extensive regulatory requirements and provides data resolutions of sub 1cm per pixel. 

The primary design philosophy behind the PrecisionHawk technology is to place as much intelligence into the platform as possible. This allows the system to operate in the most reliable and repeatable fashions. This philosophy provides a platform that is readily operable with only a minimal amount of training.

Unlike the approach of most UAV companies on the market, our system is not built for an expert UAV pilot. Loaded with artificial intelligence, our UAV is built for a non-technical operator and can be learned to operate within a few hours.

The PrecisionHawk platform comes with a fully integrated Sensor Suite. The suite is Plug-and-Play and Field-Swappable so users have the flexibility they need to get the data you need. Mapping their flights is simple with their flight planning software that uses Intelligent Sensor-Specific Flight Planning Sensors. Choose the survey boundaries, the sensor, the required ground resolution or altitude and let the flight plan software do the rest. It will detect the sensor and the trigger’s optimal overlap so the users data is reliable and complete.

The PrecisionHawk data platform provides autonomous transfer from the UAV into the cloud where it can be processed and analyzed on the Data Mapper software and accessed on a desktop or mobile device. 

The team is comprised of professionals with extensive backgrounds in remote sensing, unmanned aircraft operations, software development, data processing and GIS systems development."

"UpGuard's proprietary technology tests an organization's IT infrastructure both internally and externally and calculates the potential risk for future intrusions and outages. Upon evaluating the ongoing configuration state of every server and network device, companies are given an easy-to-understand score called CSTAR — a single number which indicates to IT staff as well as their executives their risk level for data breaches. An organization's CSTAR score can even be used by corporate insurers in creating a cybersecurity insurance policy.

Thousands of companies, including ADP, E*TRADE and Cisco Systems, use UpGuard to validate infrastructure, continuously detect risks and procure cybersecurity insurance. UpGuard is headquartered in Mountain View, CA with offices in Portland, OR. To see how UpGuard works, or to get your CSTAR rating, visit www.upguard.com."
