"DB Networks?? innovates cyber security through intelligent continuous monitoring. Our customers include the world?ﾀ?s largest financial institutions, health care providers, manufacturers, and governments.

We provide customers new insights and a situational awareness of their IT infrastructure including four primary benefits:

    * A comprehensive inventory of their databases
    * Characterizing the interactions between applications and their connected databases
    * Network policy management for the core infrastructure
    * Behavioral analysis based database security to identify attacks immediately and accurately

Intelligent continuous monitoring ""shines a light"" on what's really going on in your infrastructure. For example, undocumented and unmanaged databases may contain highly sensitive information and offer cyber attackers an enormously large attack surface. DB Networks non-intrusively discovers all databases and the interactions of users and applications to their connected databases. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) operating inside the core network introduce new, or alter user/application interactions. DB Networks maps all of these application interactions to rapidly identify APTs. Continuous monitoring the core network also identifies policy violations such as restricted databases being exposed to unrestricted network segments.

DB Networks?ﾀ? unique approach to intelligent database security utilizes machine learning and behavioral analysis to automatically create models of each applications proper interactions with their connected databases. These models are used to immediately and accurately identify database attacks. With no signature files to deal with or endless false positives to chase down operational support of DB Networks products becomes trivial.

DB Networks is a privately held company headquartered in San Diego, California."

MetaLINCS was founded to address the growing problem of intelligently finding important information within email repositories. Email has become the cornerstone of business communications and organizations. The automatic capture of email communication in messaging systems creates a natural record of critical messages, context of important decisions and inherent communication patterns. Consequently, organizations are spending billions of dollars on email analysis, often as part of an investigatory discovery process or EDiscovery. Current technologies and traditional methods do not leverage the unique qualities of electronic messaging and hence do not adequately address this issue. The application of single techniques such as keyword search, knowledge management, databases or natural language processing are not sufficient. What is required is an intelligent combination of multiple technologies.

"Fountain helps whenever one is stuck on a problem, by connecting one with a highly rated expert who can help. In under 5 minutes one will be connected 1-on-1 through video chat, text and photos with annotation. Whether one has a gardening, plumbing or design project, they have the expert looked for.

Fountain was borne out of Aaron Patzer's frustration with answering basic questions using the internet. While the internet is great for finding facts and documents, it often falls short for anything personal: home, health, relationships, pets, and anything nuanced: business, personal finance, and legal decisions. By contrast, a live, two-way interactive conversation provides far more useful information - often far faster - than searching, sifting, and endless Googling.

The wider goal of Fountain is a new type of search: plain English typed or spoken is understood, and the asker is connected instantly to the person most qualified to answer and assist. They are using artificial intelligence in the service of connecting to the most powerful intelligence: another human."

ABOUT US
Documaster AS was spun off from NorseLAB (www.norselab.com) in January 2014 after a successful two-year project aimed at building a modern minimalistic records management kernel for the needs of the public sector in Norway. Our parent company has been active in the area of records management since 2003 and currently has more than 450 government agencies as customers.

Documaster became the first company to offer an independent kernel certified by the National Archives of Norway. We did not stop there and expanded our business to the private sector as well. Currently we have offices in three cities in two countries. The company continues to grow and pursue both new markets and highly skilled talented people across the globe.

Our goal is twofold. First, we want to reduce unnecessary costs and make work both in the public and private sector easier and less frustrating. Second, we want to give new life to valuable records locked in legacy systems by storing the records in standard structures and making them easily accessible even decades from now.

We do this by bringing together several technologies such as Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Graph Databases to make the job of the modern knowledge worker easier and more efficient."

"Mariana reduces costs of acquiring prospects by up to 50X by doing B2B marketing in reverse.

Typically, B2B marketing uses a catch-as-catch-can approach using a conflicting mix of broad yet siloed (by channel) approaches to find prospects, with only 1 in 4 are qualified before handed to sales. 95% of these leads do not convert. 

Mariana is a new model that reverses that, delivering on the promise of personalized marketing by flipping how marketing is done. Not marketing then picking people. Instead picking people then creating the right marketing:

1. FIRST THE RIGHT PERSON. Mariana has almost 50K real-time data points to find the living, 360?? picture of each single prospect.

2. THEN THE RIGHT CONTENT. Because you know each person, you know what each person wants.

3. THE RIGHT CHANNEL. Mariana knows the right place each content resonates--a harmony of many channels looking like one.

4. AND THE RIGHT TIME. We process real-time, thousands of times a day so any time you are on time.

Out of stealth in Q4 2015, Mariana doubled revenue goals in Q3, and is now looking for one or two investors to close its seed round 10/15/15, led by Blumberg Capital."

"We build autonomous drone solutions for inspection & surveillance

Drones hold the potential to disrupt multi-billion dollar industries including energy, security, insurance, agriculture and more. Drones completely change the way inspection, measurement, surveillance and deliveries are done today. Still, the main barrier of making them a must-have platform is the ability of drones to perform tasks autonomously.

Imagine power line inspections, gas pipe inspections, and radiation measurements all done by drones. Moreover, imagine a fleet of drones serving as a search and rescue team - all crucial tasks in large markets. When these tasks require 1-2 operators to pilot each drone, the applications remain the same as they have been until today - limited. Drones must perform their missions without any human intervention in order to become solutions that are truly disruptive.

We believe that only a drone solution in which the drones are physically on site, performing a number of diverse tasks, while being operated remotely through a cloud software will disrupt traditional industries. Our technologies and solutions enable exactly that."

"Cyberlytic is a cyber security company based in the UK.  Our software applies a patent pending, machine learning classification approach, which triages cyber attacks detected by existing security systems. The Cyber Threat Profiler provides real-time risk assessment of cyber attacks, increasing the effectiveness of security teams, by prioritising their workload and enabling them to respond immediately to the most serious attacks.

It has been widely publicised that a global shortage of cyber security professionals has caused businesses and governments to struggle to protect their systems and information against a rapidly increasing cyber threat. At the same time, cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated with conventional perimeter defences proving to be insufficient. The result is that security teams are becoming increasingly overwhelmed with the volume of attacks and that security breaches are becoming more frequent. Security teams need a way of prioritising their response in order to minimise the risk of compromise and the associated cost and reputational damage as a consequence.

The CTP connects to existing security systems to analyse the underlying attack data. It prioritises cyber attacks by using a unique classification approach to determine the capability of the attacker, together with the relative sophistication and effectiveness of each attack. Machine learning is used to continually update and adapt the classification ruleset and provide highly accurate results. The CTP enables security teams to be more efficient by:
?ﾀ?	Focusing on high risk cyber-attacks;
?ﾀ?	Providing expert decision support and;
?ﾀ?	Reducing incident response times from days to seconds."

The company is launching its first product at TechCrunch called StockMood.  Which can be found at www.StockMood.com

StockMood.com uses analyze news stories, classify their sentiment, and then measure their potential impact on a stock's price direction.

Each article is individually ingested, and its sentiment assessed by natural language processing models. While the models aren't perfect, users can correct the sentiment rating produced by the system.  This crowd-sourcing technology allows the AI engine to constantly improve its accuracy.

Mood measures how a stock????????s price responds to news. When a stock is in a good Mood that means the stock price responds very favorably to good news, and has a tendency to shrug off the bad news. The opposite is true for bad Mood. The more this happens the stronger the mood in that direction gets.

When both the mood and the sentiment values for a stock reach certain empirically determined thresholds, a Sentiment Alert is issued, indicating a statistical probability for movement over the next 5 days. Sentiment alerts can be positive or negative. These Alerts  suggest that a stock may be at a peak of optimism or a peak of pessimism, respectively.  Our statistical analyses have shown that, at the time of an Overoptimism or Overpessimism Alert,  trading in the opposite direction of the news can provide significant edge."

"Gatfol Technology represents a compact, elegant and massively scalable technique for changing keyword search into man-to-machine questioning communication. The technology provides an invisible (to the user) universal tool that acts as interpreter between unsophisticated user input and what application based information ""requires"" for efficient retrieval.

The Gatfol project was started roughly 12 years ago in the UK. A small team of financial experts developed an intelligent accounting system that analysed patterns in accounting data. This formed the basis of the Gatfol technology currently in development and received an EMDA Innovation in Software award from the European Union in 2006.

The rationale for the Gatfol pursuit is that, with all the work that has been done towards creating artificial intelligence in computers over many decades, it is still not possible to talk to computers on a human-to-human basis.

While it is Gatfol's big vision to eventually enable humans to converse with data, a more immediate goal encompasses data search, because search is effectively talking to information. Current efforts are concentrated on applying Gatfol's technology to improve search using semantic intelligence (meaning in data), both on the web and in proprietary databases."

"Farmeto is a tool for connecting small farmers with buyers to create Pareto efficient markets via advanced forecasting and pricing models.

Farmeto is a software tool that fills the gap for large retailers interested in buying local crops to bring to market. Consumers demand local crops because they like supporting their local community, supporting their local economy, and having quality produce that is more fresh and able to be produced without the burden of pesticides. This is possible in the local market due to the reduced time requirements for distribution. With the cost of fuel rising, the premium paid for locally grown crops that take less advantage of economies of scale is offset by the distribution cost from larger farms that are more aware of the economics of production. Large retailers generally have evolved to deal with large vendors who represent their products rather than myriad small producers. This industry evolution represents a difficulty with an unmet solution in this market. There are no tools similar to Farmeto in the market. The most similar structure is that of the regional co-op, where an entity represents various regional farms. There is no direct competition with these entities and Farmeto, as co-ops would be valid users of the software, or farmers could use the service directly.

The founders of Farmeto are David Tanner and Colin Shaw. We met in the late '90s while we were finishing our undergraduate degrees at UA. David was finishing in Architecture and Colin was finishing in Mathematics and Physics. We have worked together on numerous projects, particularly over the last four years, as well as previous to this on a less frequent basis (both of us having moved to other areas in the years prior). We have found that we work well together, both being able to objectively contribute to projects without the hindrance of hurt feelings when changes need to be made or strategies altered from what we first considered. We also have the enthusiasm to see projects through.

Notable projects that we have worked on include Factiki, which was a search engine tool where a user would suggest a topic and Factiki would crawl the web producing sound byte fact abstractions including citations. These facts were ranked and voted on by active users to assess, for a specific topic, what information was most important about the topic. Users were paid proportional to the ad revenue displayed by topics they suggested. Additional revenue was derived from consumers wanting specific information about user impressions of facts (as opposed to the default page view which simply ranked the facts). Factiki went offline in 2011. 

We have also worked on Esprit Audio (http://www.espritaudio.com), which is a public information tool for audio design, and advertising for our own audio products. 

We have worked to bring a robotics project to market. This project is an autonomous robot capable of subterranean geometry measurement, creating CAD drawing output of subterranean features. The prototype is currently in the late stages of development and the details are not up for significant discussion.

We have worked on other, smaller projects, and have assisted as consultants on projects beyond those that we have developed ourselves. In each situation we have been able to work effectively together and generate new ideas, find clever solutions, and see projects through."

TM2 (TM Squared) a materials company formed in 2005 to develop carbon/metal materials called covetics (named in 2010).  The first patent issued by USPTO January 2013, five additional patents issued in 2013 with more patent-pending.  The patents describe materials within a new class of materials called covetics, where carbon at the nano-scale is infused and bonded with base metals and their alloys in a single phase which cannot be separated by re-melting.  The nanocarbon bonding allows tailoring of the finished covetic by adjusting carbon content and post processing to enhance the properties of the base metal such as conductivities, durability, and corrosion resistance.  The first $5M investment in TM2 was used to secure composition of matter patents, to develop production procedures and robotics for repeatable control, to setup a studio/research lab (in Dayton, OH), and to develop an understanding of the ?ﾀ?covetic?ﾀ? bond and the properties of covetics (first peer-reviewed paper submitted November 2013 by University of Maryland under Academic Research License from TM2).  Market research has been performed in numerous industries following the traditional metals segments of copper, silver, gold and aluminum as well as analysis of the nanocarbon markets concentrating on graphene, CNTs and other carbon allotropes.  Covetics have been shown to contain sp2 and sp3 nanocarbon structures and graphene-like nanoribbons, which enhance many properties of the base metal.  Enhanced properties of covetics, when fully developed, will replace metals in many applications.  Silver covetics, for instance, is very easy to work with, casts into finer part geometry, hardens beyond pure silver without alloying and resists tarnish well beyond fine silver.  Copper covetics can carry much higher current density, with higher tensile strength and resists corrosion better than pure copper.  Capital to acquire production equipment to apply covetics into specific products is being raised.

"Artificial Intelligence for medical image analysis

Knowing that the earlier cancer is detected, the better the life expectancy, accurate radiological detection can make the difference between life and death. Even the most experienced radiologist can make mistakes, and in up to 70% of cases, undetected cancer was visible retrospectively on previous imaging examinations. Unfortunately, because of the current shortage of radiologists in the healthcare system, access to second opinion is often not possible.

Existing Computed Assisted Diagnosis (CADx) software use traditional image analysis techniques and even with their accuracy in dispute, any performance improvement is better than none in this second viewer approach. However the high rate of false positives and false negative has refrained most of radiologists to adopt them in their daily practices. Artificial intelligence with its recent deep learning techniques is already providing superhuman pattern recognition performance and is anticipated to become a game changer in medical image analysis."

"Mental health conditions are the leading cause of disabilities and loss of quality of life, affecting 60 Million Americans. 

Someone struggling with these conditions may try self-help strategies, like books or apps. But it's hard to find science-based solutions, and most of them have one-size-fits-all approaches.

The other option is to seek professional help, like psychiatrists and psychologists. But it can be intimidating and expensive. 

In this unfortunate scenario, it can takes ten years to find help and only 30% of individuals have adequate treatment.

Youper is re-thinking how people take care of their mental health.

Youper starts empowering people with digital self-management tools that have been designed using evidence-based protocols and are tailored to each user?ﾀ?s needs.

Digital self-management tools provide actionable information, behavior changing experiences, emotional resilience, and peer support. These tools have the potential to deliver all the users need to overcome their condition.

Sometimes users will need professional help, and Youper can anticipate that. The platform analyzes the user's behavior, suggests professional help, and helps the users to engage better with a mental health professional.

Youper is an effective, personal and stigma-free tool to empower the patient before, during and after consulting a health professional.

We are creating a platform that uses artificial intelligence and behavior analytics to improve self-help tools and generate clinical insights to boost pharmacological and psychological treatments. 

The first platform's module is helping people overcome social anxiety, a condition that affects 15 Million Americans.

The analysis of the first data, using clinically validated measurement for social anxiety, show that users are improving their condition and are having life-changing outcomes.
 
We believe that our team is well positioned to make this happen. We understand the complexity of the mental health care, and we have the mission to scale disruptive solutions.

"ACS CompIQ Corp is the leader in providing Medical Cost Containment Service for the workers compensation and liability insurance industry. Our proprietary Web-based software application, IQReview, provides savings and efficiency by re-pricing medical bills to the appropriate state fee schedule, usual and customary, or facility fee schedule. IQReview uses an Artificial Intelligence based computational procedure for duplicate bill checking. This process provides the most accurate and sophisticated method ever developed for eliminating duplicated charges of any kind.

Many companies, large and small, entrust ACS CompIQ with their medical bill review work. ACS CompIQ's patented auditing process insures accuracy, screens for unnecessary services and applies the deepest network savings available. With the amazing IQReview, our team of expert bill agents double checks every bill for accuracy.

ACS CompIQ will answer all provider questions and handle every re-evaluation. Our turnaround time and savings are setting the performance standard in the industry.

ACS CompIQ Corp is very successful at developing customized EDI interfaces. The reality is that EVERY EDI interface is customized to a certain degree. Because we have world class software developers on staff, we are comfortable with even the most advanced levels of customization.???? Our expertise extends to a wide variety of EDI interface technologies including the latest trends in XML web services for real time data transfer.

The integration most often used for our clients begins with EDI transfer of claim and provider records from the claims management system to our bill review system.??IQReview captures this data and makes it available to the bill review analyst's production use. Importantly, IQReview tracks any unique identifiers used by the claims system and returns them as part of the next step, which is the EDI transfer of payments records back to the claims management system.?? This allows the claims management system to identify internal claim and vendor records associated with each payment with 100% accuracy and no manual intervention.?? Many organizations have a need to interface with multiple claims databases and even different claims systems simultaneously.??IQReview supports this requirement and automatically segments claim and vendor records so that the user is only presented with records from the appropriate claims system during production.

IQReview interfaces with all major claims management systems such as:?? David, David Renaissance, Risk Master, VOS, VOS Portal, Talisman, Sucaba, Pyramid, Stars, RiskCo, and Gensource.?? As we add new clients we continually build new interfaces to client specifications.?? The interface is provided via EDI (electronic data interface) to receive claims data and vendor data from an external system as well as transmit payment information to an external system. Payment information may include bill review fees, PPO fees and more broken down in whatever manner is appropriate to our customers' AP system.??Additionally, IQReview provides data to claims systems in an EDI format to allow the printing of EOR information on check stubs.??
EDI files can be transmitted via email, FTP, or floppy disk.?? Information is also compliant with OLE, DB/ADO/ODBC - making it possible to work with any database engine.
ACS CompIQ can accept import data in almost any format.?? Likewise, we can accommodate almost any format needed for export.?? Files are usually fixed-length ASCII data."

"Emoshape is a UK startup company, setup and owned by Patrick Levy Rosenthal, which develops powerful emotional technology. The company was the first to create a prototype in which the projection of an image, a ball, could be seen 13 inches away from the screen and yet the user was able to hit the ball directly with their hand, without the need for any special equipment or interface. Emoshape continue to create products with the aim of increasing their users' interactive experience, the most recent being. The EmoSpark Cube is the first Artificial Intelligence console - it's a translucent, android powered Wi-Fi/Bluetooth cube that allows users to create and interact with an emotionally concise intelligence through conversation, music, and visual media. Over time, the cube creates a customized Emotional Profile Graph (EPG) which collects and measures a unique emotional input from the user. The EPG allows the cube to virtually ?ﾀ?feel?ﾀ? senses such as pleasure and pain; and ?ﾀ?expresses?ﾀ? those desires according to the user. Emo Spark will take not only gaming, but also your TV, smart phone or computer to an entirely different level from anything ever experienced before.

Emoshape has started the prototyping of the first Emotions Processing Unit ?ﾀ? EPU on DSP in the prototyping of a first generation of processor representing a significant advancement for the purpose of Artificial Intelligence Devices and Technologies. 

Emoshape receieved the 2005 IST Prize from the European Council for Applied Science, Technology and Engineering.

TronMe software is a patented multimedia player, developed by EmoPlayer, using a proprietary interactive video and Interactive music audio format the IVS which appeared early 2006 in the United Kingdom. TronMe is a player which allows several actions on track and video; there are the different segments of the song; the verse, chorus, bridge, introduction and the different instruments used on each track are also separated; each track is broken down into bits. The user takes these building blocks and makes their own unique live video mix of the song.

3D Solar display:
The patented 3D Solar display devices create a 3D image of objects hovering 13 inches away from the screen. The object can also appear to rotate 180 degrees without the need for specialised glasses. Users are able to manipulate the virtual image directly with their hands as they would a real object.

Because each image is created using a single 2Dview, content providers will not have to incorporate hundreds or thousands of separate images to create the 3Dsolar effect thus enabling them to re-focus on their core business and develop 3D images more rapidly.

They are developing software to enable Question-Answering for Enterprise and Business Intelligence (BI) applications, using sophisticated Natural Language Processing / Computational Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence techniques. According to Gartner, Natural Language Question Answering systems ?ﾀ? currently exemplified by non-enterprise products such as Google, Siri, and IBM Watson ?ﾀ? could soon be destined for the Enterprise domain as well. Gartner predicted that 70 percent of leading BI vendors would have incorporated natural-language capabilities by 2016, likely using technologies developed externally rather than by the BI vendors themselves. While this of course presents an enormous potential for disruption in the $13-billion BI market, there has yet to be a pervasive product offering in this regard. This is likely due to the significant technical challenges of applying traditional Q&A and search technologies to the unique technical environments of Enterprise. Their company focuses on addressing these challenges, and developing the underlying technologies that would enable the Enterprise Question-Answering applications of the future.

FY/c also uses it's algorithms to help buyers figure out which attributes -- not features -- of a cloud service such as high security or 24/7 support are right for them. This needs assessment tool asks buyers a series of questions that focus not on particular feature set but on the appropriateness of the service for their company.

This knowledge helps buyers choose the right provider for their needs, not on their wants.

"HydroRun Technologies Ltd. is the developer of the HydroKite???, a new concept in renewable hydroelectricity production from rivers.

The HydroKite??? provides affordable, base-load, green electricity from the natural, unaltered flow of rivers.  The HydroKite??? is a modular, scalable system that can be easily transported to, and installed in suitable river reaches to meet grid-connected or off-grid demands.  

The modular nature of HydroKite??? makes it an ideal platform for a wide scale of projects from individual units to IPP clusters.  A 1 km stretch of river can easily accommodate a 1MW project at a capital cost of $4/W and availability that is 3-4 times higher than typical photovoltaic and wind installations.  The average cost of electricity from such HydroKite??? projects is significantly below the average price of grid electricity in North America (12??/kWh), offering substantial financial returns to individuals (net-metering) and IPPs alike.

The HydroKite??? has on-board guidance and monitoring systems.  This allows the HydroKite??? to optimize its operations for maximum power production.  However, whenever the system detects other objects in the river, such as logs floating below the surface or recreational boating or fish , the on-board system steers the unit away from any potential collision.  

The HydroKite??? protects the environment by design.  Given our objective to harness energy as economically as possible from a river, we place HydroKite??? units where the stream flow is strongest.  In contrast, fish, such as salmon, like to swim where the stream flows are weaker.  This happy coincidence leads our units to have no impact on fish and fishing activities.  Finally, by avoiding any change in the natural flow of the stream or extensive structures on the streambed, we ensure that spawning grounds and the ecology of the river are unaltered. 
 
Our ethos at HydroRun is to use engineering innovation to deliver economic, social and environmental sustainability.  Through excellence in hydrokinetic design, robotics and manufacturing we have developed a solution that generates electricity at a grid competitive price while protecting the natural beauty of rivers, fish habitats and other river uses.
 
HydroRun Technologies Ltd. is a BC owned and operated company, with offices in Vancouver and Burnaby."

INNOVYA - Traceless Biometric System is using a fuzzy algorithm method/logic for identifying an individual through a biometric identifier that is designed to be non-unique. Fuzzy logic is a type of mathematic algorithms and programming that more accurately represents how the human brain categorizes objects, evaluates conditions, and processes decisions. Fuzzy logic allows an object to belong to a set to a certain degree or with a certain confidence. Instead of using unique biometric information, an amorphous identifier(s) agent is replacing it. The amorphous agent is an incomplete identifier obtained from a fresh scanned biometric information which is non-unique. Another alterable limit indicator(s) form a document can be added to overturn non-unique combinations to become unique. By ?ﾀ?incomplete?ﾀ? or ?ﾀ?alterable?ﾀ? we mean that the biometric information itself or the document cannot be reconstructed from the identifier(s) even with the device that originally allocated the agent or the ?ﾀ?Biometric Identifier Token?ﾀ?. Using this method, the individual has to be present (with his document during the identification process since the (secret) token identifier itself has no true value except in a particular biometric identification transaction. This is important in order to avoid an association with recorded values or any other unique characteristic.

"We build autonomous drone solutions for inspection & surveillance

Drones hold the potential to disrupt multi-billion dollar industries including energy, security, insurance, agriculture and more. Drones completely change the way inspection, measurement, surveillance and deliveries are done today. Still, the main barrier of making them a must-have platform is the ability of drones to perform tasks autonomously.

Imagine power line inspections, gas pipe inspections, and radiation measurements all done by drones. Moreover, imagine a fleet of drones serving as a search and rescue team - all crucial tasks in large markets. When these tasks require 1-2 operators to pilot each drone, the applications remain the same as they have been until today - limited. Drones must perform their missions without any human intervention in order to become solutions that are truly disruptive.

We believe that only a drone solution in which the drones are physically on site, performing a number of diverse tasks, while being operated remotely through a cloud software will disrupt traditional industries. Our technologies and solutions enable exactly that."

"Remote Insight is commercializing big data analytics of satellite remote sensing imagery, initially as a direct service offering, supporting the Environmental, Health and Safety programs of midstream oil and gas pipeline operators.  Remote Insight offers automated monitoring services that reduce the response time to pipeline related incidents, improving safety and reducing the cleanup and mitigation costs for the operators.  

To meet U.S. federal regulations, transmission pipeline operators within the U.S. are currently required to patrol over 400,000 miles of pipeline, at intervals ranging from once every two weeks to once per year.  On average, every day, somewhere within the U.S., enough pipeline to run between Seattle to Los Angeles is patrolled.  These patrols, which are primarily looking for construction encroachment and obvious signs of leakage, are currently conducted on foot, in a vehicle, or most commonly, by a manned aircraft.  

In aggregate, U.S. transmission pipeline operators currently spend approximately $250M/year to address pipeline patrol.  Despite these efforts, there are still approximately 10 fatalities, 50 injuries, and $300M in property damage yearly in pipeline related incidents in the U.S, per the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

Remote Insight?ﾀ?s machine learning software and business processes automation streamlines the detection of construction encroachment and obvious signs of leaks in pipeline right-of-way, using inexpensive, commercially available space-based imagery.  Remote Insight?ﾀ?s approach results in a more timely detection of hazardous conditions, and by leveraging the relatively inexpensive distributed computing horsepower of the cloud, Remote Insight?ﾀ?s approach also offers a more thorough analysis of the imagery resulting in detection and prediction of more subtle hazards. 

Remote Insight?ﾀ?s technology, business processes, and strategic partnerships are ultimately suited to become the de-facto standard across a much broader range of vertical markets served by space-based imagery platforms, as the cost of the imagery drops and the quality of the imagery improves.  Remote Insight is well positioned to take advantage of the environment created as imagery vendors including Skybox Imaging, Planet Labs, OmniEarth and Satellogic commoditize the imagery itself, and seek to differentiate from one another through analytics offerings."

"What is trackle?
trackle is a fully integrated wearable system that helps women to identify their individual fertility window by tracking the body core temperature.

What makes trackle relevant right now? 
With increasing age, the likelihood of getting pregnant lowers rapidly. Women who want to have kids lately need to know exactly about their fertility window in order to increase chances of getting pregnant.  
Same applies for women who want to avoid pregnancy without hormone treatments. For them, it is important to know when their ovulation happens in order to choose the right means for contraception.  Knowing the individual fertility window becomes more and more relevant to a growing group of women. 

What is the problem trackle is solving? 
Identifying that rise of the body core temperature is challenging ?ﾀ? especially as you need to avoid all noise that influences body core temperature. That is why women measure core temperature first thing in the morning before having moved. Thus, they operate with approximate values they enter into old fashioned scale paper graphs.

How does trackle work?
The wearable sensor is worn vaginal overnight and determines the core temperature every hour. It regularly transmits the values via a wireless connection to a gateway, which passes it on to a server. On the server it is processed and provided for the user?ﾀ?s mobile app.  Thus, the one and only relevant value can be identified easily: it is the lowest value measured overnight. In comparison to the other values taken the nights before, ovulation can be identified very securely and with our mature machine learning system, we are able to predict the exact timing of ovulation closer the more data we receive. The gateway serves as a safe and discrete storage box for the sensor also."

A long time back, They started out as an intellectual endeavor to build an Artificial Intelligence agent (AI agent) that can make decisions just like the human brain does. i.e. not just by considering economic & tangible criteria involved in decision making, but also evolutionary, emotional & psychological elements involved.

However, They could not use any of the traditional AI approaches which use inductive methods of coming to a conclusion, since it would take an incredible amount of space & processing power to make even slightly complex decisions.

They decided to build a new framework to profile excitation patterns of different areas of the human brain that are involved closely in decision making & to emulate the decision pathways in the human brain to make Their AI agent think & act. After months of research, programming, validation studies & pilots later - They launched Their first behavior simulation engine!"

"XTRER.com is a philanthropic, mobile applications platform for monetizing subscription text content, creating revenues for content owners and charitable causes. 

The company is the brainchild of Simon Luttrell, a former rocket scientist who has been innovating in the mobile sector since 1999.  His previous ventures include Fonedata, (sold to Psion plc), Link77 (who developed the Artificial Intelligence SMS chat service called Natachata), and Mobile Crazy TV (an SMS-to-TV channel on the Sky satellite bouquet).

Simon retired to live in rural Thailand several years ago, but his experiences in south-east Asia has prompted him to use his skills to develop a user-friendly solution for monetizing mobile content.  The XTRER platform offers 'channels' of daily content to subscribers, at a rate chosen by the channel owner of between 10-34 cents per day.

The content channels could be a horoscope, weather report, share price, recipe tips, health advice - in short, any type of legal content that has a value to another person.  A new channel can be created within a few minutes using the online tool, with no technical knowledge required.

Subscribers can join their chosen channel by simply texting the channel name to XTRER's short-code number.  Currently, the XTRER platform is live on 10 of the major mobile networks in the U.S., and is being rolled out in Australia, India and the UK within the next few weeks.

Channel owners can donate a specified % of the revenue earned from their subscribers to a nominated charity, or for general charitable distribution.  The amount that they donate could be anything between 0% and 100% - it's totally up to them.  XTRER then adds a bonus by donating to these charities a figure between 10 and 100% of the profit that they earn from each channel subscriber.

When a subscriber joins any content channel, in the first month of their subscription, Xtrer will donate 10% of the profits earned from the subscriber.  For every month that they stay subscribed, Xtrer will increase the donation by 10%.  After 10 months, Xtrer will be donating 100% of the profit that the company earns

Channel owners submit their daily content messages to the XTRER platform by a variety of methods.  Some choose to log into their accounts from their desktop PCs, others choose to originate their content by text message, whilst others can automatically submit their content using the XTRER API.  In all cases, these content messages are carefully checked for inappropriate wording before being sent to the mobile phones of channel subscribers.  'Spamming' subscribers with multiple messages is not possible, since the XTRER platform restricts sending to a single message per day.

Social networks such as Twitter are an ideal source of authors for new channel content, so XTRER also offers the facility to 'pair' an XTRER channel with a Twitter account.  One can then send out the daily content messages directly from the Twitter account."
