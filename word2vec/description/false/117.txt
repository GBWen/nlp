Niara’s security analytics platform automates the detection of attacks that have bypassed an organization’s perimeter defenses and dramatically reduces the time and skill needed to investigate and respond to security events. The solution applies machine learning algorithms to data from the network and security infrastructure to detect compromised users, entities, and malicious insiders, reduce the time for incident investigation and response, and speed threat hunting efforts by focusing security teams on the threats that matter. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, Calif., the company is backed by NEA, Index Ventures, and Venrock. For more information, visit www.niara.com."
