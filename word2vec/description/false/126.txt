The current model of the PrecisionHawk UAV is called the Lancaster Mark III.  PrecisionHawkâ€™s unmanned aircraft system is a small, robotic plane that can collect extremely high-resolution, remote sensing data with minimal effort. The aircraft itself is lightweight (1.3 kilograms), small (less than 1 meter from nose to tail), silent (runs on brushless electric motors) and is designed to be extremely easy to use. The aircraft automatically computes flight paths, survey parameters, take-off and landing paths, as well as other vital information. Once the survey is complete, the on-board computers will automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks and transfer all remote sensing data, flight information and diagnostics to remote servers. Users are never required to manually generate or plot mission paths or build flight plans based off of weather conditions. Instead, the aircraft will automatically adapt to its current conditions.
