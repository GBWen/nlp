The artificial intelligence that operates all elements of the UAV, including the aerial and data decisions throughout the PrecisionHawk system, is the core reason behind PrecisionHawk’s ability to secure sub 1 cm per pixel imagery, a market-leading aerial resolution. The Artificial Intelligence approach also eliminates the need for a technical operator.  In addition, the aircraft is equipped with advanced diagnostic capabilities, enabling it to monitor all facets of the mission from power consumption to airframe fatigue to survey quality. The Lancaster MK III operates at altitudes below that of manned aviation. This reduces the burden of extensive regulatory requirements and provides data resolutions of sub 1cm per pixel.
