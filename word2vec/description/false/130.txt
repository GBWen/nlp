The PrecisionHawk platform comes with a fully integrated Sensor Suite. The suite is Plug-and-Play and Field-Swappable so users have the flexibility they need to get the data you need. Mapping their flights is simple with their flight planning software that uses Intelligent Sensor-Specific Flight Planning Sensors. Choose the survey boundaries, the sensor, the required ground resolution or altitude and let the flight plan software do the rest. It will detect the sensor and the triggerâ€™s optimal overlap so the users data is reliable and complete.
