"Xenex was founded by Dr. Julie Stachowiak and Dr. Mark Stibich, both holding PhDs in epidemiology from Johns Hopkins. The Xenex mission is to save lives and reduce suffering by destroying deadly microorganisms that can cause hospital acquired infections (HAIs). Xenex’s Pulsed Xenon Full Spectrum™ UV Disinfection Solution reduces the bacterial load often associated with an increased risk for HAIs. Since their commercial launch in June 2010, Xenex devices are now included in infection control protocols in almost three hundred hospitals throughout the U.S.
