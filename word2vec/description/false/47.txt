Ninebot Inc. was officially founded in 2012 by a group of robotics engineers interested in developing new technology for use in environmental protection and artificial intelligence. The engineers attended the 2009 China-Korea-Japan Robot Seminar to present their designs for the first unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used for research at Zhongshan Station in Antartica. With an R&D team, the engineers combined the technologies of their autopilot and robot technologies to develop a new type of self-balancing electric vehicle, the WindRunner.
