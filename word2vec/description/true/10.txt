The key innovation behind Signal Hub is its ability to deliver data science at scale. The end-to-end platform automatically creates Signals, which can be shared, reused, and applied to multiple use cases throughout the enterprise. Machine learning technologies keep the Signals relevant, fresh, and accurate. This approach eliminates redundancies and the need to return to the raw data for each use case, resulting in a significant improvement in productivity. In this way, Signal Hubs proprietary technology enables enterprises to overcome what has become the primary obstacle to large-scale adoption of advanced analytics: solving the scalability challenge.
