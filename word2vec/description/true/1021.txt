Incubated out of the University of Texas at Austin, Capsenta increases the value of companies data by enriching it to become a knowledge graph (semantics). Semantics improve search, analysis, and interpretation. Capsentas patented technology is the only complete turnkey solution to making existing SQL, and SQL data warehouse infrastructure, upward compatible with semantics. The approach assures scalability and robustness. Traditional applications seamlessly coexist with semantically enriched applications.
