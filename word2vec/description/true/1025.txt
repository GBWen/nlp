Application performance assurance has become the most important factor for delivering a competitive online service product. At InsightFinder, we provide smart monitoring and predictive analysis services based on cutting-edge unsupervised machine learning technologies. Our product can detect anomalous system behaviors before customers are affected. Our predictive analysis product can not only tell when but also why a performance anomaly occurs. For example,  one of our patent-pending technology supports multi-variate holistic anomaly detection and causal analysis. Compared to existing anomaly detection techniques (e.g., clustering, PCA, outlier detection), our solution achieves much higher accuracy with orders of magnitude faster analysis speed. Our solution supports continuous online learning with small memory footprint. Our technology has been evaluated and licensed by Google. Our monitoring and analytics services require zero installation (i.e., agent-less) on customers' applications or images.
