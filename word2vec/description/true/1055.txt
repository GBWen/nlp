When both the mood and the sentiment values for a stock reach certain empirically determined thresholds, a Sentiment Alert is issued, indicating a statistical probability for movement over the next 5 days. Sentiment alerts can be positive or negative. These Alerts  suggest that a stock may be at a peak of optimism or a peak of pessimism, respectively.  Our statistical analyses have shown that, at the time of an Overoptimism or Overpessimism Alert,  trading in the opposite direction of the news can provide significant edge."
