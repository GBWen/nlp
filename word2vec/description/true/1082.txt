We believe that ARIELs technologies can lead a paradigm shift from single gene (Mendelian) genetics to multifaceted, complicated gene to gene interactions that interface with familial and environmental factors to provide a more comprehensive view of disease trajectory and precise therapeutic options. Our SMART-MD platform integrates the patients symptoms and genetics (derived through Next Generation Sequencing of more than 700 gene targets) with complex medical information that includes systems modeling, machine learning and other advanced reporting technology. The process tests one patient and his or her disease behavior against databases of well-mapped, complex disease patterns to help determine both the underlying causes of the disease and the optimal treatment plan.
