Incelligent software applies machine learning on big data collected from heterogeneous sources (network and non-network) in order to recognize patterns, identify hidden correlations and predict future situations of networks. It further uses these analytics/foresights to build knowledge and provide recommendations on the optimal configuration for the foreseen context in real time, thus enabling a next generation, self-optimizing network."
