VanGogh Imaging is developing 3D computer vision technology for portable and mobile applications.  Our embedded software will greatly enhance the end-users experience for mobile applications across a host of platforms ranging from smartphones to tablets. There are many mobile applications in medical, manufacturing, security, and entertainment that can greatly benefit from specifically tailored computer vision approaches to measure, record, and recognize shapes accurately. In the past, these mobile applications did not consider using 3D computer vision technology due cost and complexity. Recent advances in cameras, projectors, and algorithms have dramatically reduced the cost and complexity of 3D computer vision while improving overall accuracy.
