AddStructure was born serendipitously out of a graduate artificial intelligence research project that began at University of Illinois at Chicago. The research team, led by Dr. Bing Liu, pioneered several novel approaches to extracting and analyzing information from unstructured text. In 2014, a demo website showcasing the technology was discovered by a large restaurant review company. After three weeks, AddStructure went from an academic experiment to a commercialized product serving the Review Website and Retail industries."
