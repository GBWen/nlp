Intentiva's uCentric interface is an interface that recognizes peoples intentions, allowing them to interact with TVs, PCs or other home devices by simply pointing at them with a finger or waving a hand (patents pending). Currently it uses an input from a depth camera such as Xbox Kinect, Asus Xtion, or a PrimeSense sensor. A version that accepts inputs from a standard webcam will be available in mid 2014."
