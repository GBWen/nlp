Millennials communicate with images, videos and emojis on social networks like Facebook. They use stickers, send selfies and record their voices. Millennials care about specific rather than generic. They are not influenced by traditional advertising, they search from their peers, from people who are like them. They want to see, hear, touch, feel the product, but they also have specific questions they want answered. The new generation is not so easily fooled by traditional marketing.
