IQ Capital is a technology focused venture capital investor. We are approachable, straightforward and an extremely well connected team, working together for over 10 years to support founders achieve excellent exits. Our recent exits include acquisitions by Google, Apple, Becton Dickinson and Huawei and we have achieved a number of IPOs. We are currently investing from IQ Capital Fund II (2015 vintage) into IP-rich software tech companies which use B2B models, from embedded systems to conventional SaaS, data analytics and machine learning to very sector-specific propositions such as bioinformatics and e-health. We also have an allocation for hardware-focused investments.
