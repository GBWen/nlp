"Coolan is bringing crowdsourced, predictive analytics to the data center. Using automated, real-time information aggregated from the data center environments of a community of operators, Coolans platform leverages machine learning to provide peer benchmarking and historical data that predicts failure trends, prevents outages, and informs purchasing decisions. We believe that bringing the community together will make hardware more efficient, enable smarter business decisions, and accelerate the pace of innovation in the data center.
