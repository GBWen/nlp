Intelligent continuous monitoring ""shines a light"" on what's really going on in your infrastructure. For example, undocumented and unmanaged databases may contain highly sensitive information and offer cyber attackers an enormously large attack surface. DB Networks non-intrusively discovers all databases and the interactions of users and applications to their connected databases. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) operating inside the core network introduce new, or alter user/application interactions. DB Networks maps all of these application interactions to rapidly identify APTs. Continuous monitoring the core network also identifies policy violations such as restricted databases being exposed to unrestricted network segments.
