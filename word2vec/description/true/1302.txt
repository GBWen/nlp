Haileos mission is to enable a complete visual fashion experience by creating the first Web scale fashion discovery engine that sees fashion as a consumer sees it. By taking the state of the art in computer vision algorithms to the next level and by introducing a novel proprietary framework that harnesses the abundant visual information on the Web, Haileo has built a self learning visual engine that understands and recognizes any fashion object in terms of its rich visual cues (e.g. style, shape, color, and pattern). As a result, Haileo's engine is the first one to usher in a tipping point online fashion experience: A consumer can use any fashion image as an inspiration (e.g. snapping a street style or a magazine page via a smartphone or any image found on social media and the web) and start discovering her world of fashion, including items in merchants catalogues and fashion inspirations from her social circle and from around the Web (e.g. celebrities and runway models wearing matching items). Haileos platform, thus, marks a generational shift in online fashion, where the whole universe of fashion items, looks, and popular sentiments are connected, literally bringing the fashion world at your fingertips.
