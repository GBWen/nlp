Yieldmo is a mobile advertising platform that optimizes revenue for publishers, ROI for marketers, and the ad-viewing experience for users. Yieldmo's Private Mobile Marketplace enables marketers to purchase high quality non-banner ad inventory in Yieldmo's patent-pending, consumer-friendly ad formats on the mobile pages and apps of premium publishers. Marketers can purchase ads directly from Yieldmo, with the assistance of their agencies or DSPs, or through participating publisher sales teams. Brands and agencies may target contextually (using 1st party data), demographically, or by specific sites on either a cost-per-click or cost-per-thousand-impressions basis. The ad placements typically appear on 100% of the publisher's mobile inventory and thus allow for an incomparable level of testing and optimization using machine learning and predictive analysis. The company is often cited as the top-performing mobile ad partner of advertisers and publishers alike.
