Occipital develops state-of-the-art mobile computer vision applications with natural user interfaces. Located in downtown Boulder, CO and San Francisco, CA, Occipital is venture-funded, was backed by Techstars in 2008 and is also known for developing RedLaser, a barcode-scanning application that was acquired by eBay Inc. In 2010, the company reinvented panoramas with 360 Panorama, an app which makes 360-degree image capture as simple and fast as recording a video clip. Occipital's latest product is the Structure Sensor, the world's first 3D sensor for mobile devices.
