The Gatfol project was started roughly 12 years ago in the UK. A small team of financial experts developed an intelligent accounting system that analysed patterns in accounting data. This formed the basis of the Gatfol technology currently in development and received an EMDA Innovation in Software award from the European Union in 2006.
