This business plan focuses exclusively on Stottler Henke's DataMontage data visualization software for rapid visual analysis of complex, time-oriented data.  DataMontage is a Java class library that displays information-dense arrays of timelines and graphics that can be stacked vertically or arranged in rows and columns, enabling users to see patterns in large, multivariate data sets that cannot be seen using traditional data displays."
