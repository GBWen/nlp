Located in downtown Chicago, Cara Health is an international, forward-thinking start-up healthcare IT company. Cara Health is developing the next generation of predictive analytics software for healthcare organizations and health IT solutions providers.  The Patient Journey Record (PaJR) system uses linguistic analysis and machine learning to amplify the effectiveness of outbound calls.  PaJR is uniquely positioned to support frailer, sicker, older or multi-morbid socially excluded patients who account for the majority of health costs.  Avoidable admissions and readmissions to hospitals drive these costs.  Cara Health pilots to date have reduced acute ambulatory care sensitive admissions by 50% across 3 sites in Ireland, and we are now embarked on pilot deployments in the US.  Founded in Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, Cara Health was a Healthbox accelerator company, and a finalist in both IBM SmartCamp and the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) Connected Care Challenge.
