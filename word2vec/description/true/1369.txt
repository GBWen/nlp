Farmeto is a software tool that fills the gap for large retailers interested in buying local crops to bring to market. Consumers demand local crops because they like supporting their local community, supporting their local economy, and having quality produce that is more fresh and able to be produced without the burden of pesticides. This is possible in the local market due to the reduced time requirements for distribution. With the cost of fuel rising, the premium paid for locally grown crops that take less advantage of economies of scale is offset by the distribution cost from larger farms that are more aware of the economics of production. Large retailers generally have evolved to deal with large vendors who represent their products rather than myriad small producers. This industry evolution represents a difficulty with an unmet solution in this market. There are no tools similar to Farmeto in the market. The most similar structure is that of the regional co-op, where an entity represents various regional farms. There is no direct competition with these entities and Farmeto, as co-ops would be valid users of the software, or farmers could use the service directly.
