The founders of Farmeto are David Tanner and Colin Shaw. We met in the late '90s while we were finishing our undergraduate degrees at UA. David was finishing in Architecture and Colin was finishing in Mathematics and Physics. We have worked together on numerous projects, particularly over the last four years, as well as previous to this on a less frequent basis (both of us having moved to other areas in the years prior). We have found that we work well together, both being able to objectively contribute to projects without the hindrance of hurt feelings when changes need to be made or strategies altered from what we first considered. We also have the enthusiasm to see projects through.
