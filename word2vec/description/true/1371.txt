Notable projects that we have worked on include Factiki, which was a search engine tool where a user would suggest a topic and Factiki would crawl the web producing sound byte fact abstractions including citations. These facts were ranked and voted on by active users to assess, for a specific topic, what information was most important about the topic. Users were paid proportional to the ad revenue displayed by topics they suggested. Additional revenue was derived from consumers wanting specific information about user impressions of facts (as opposed to the default page view which simply ranked the facts). Factiki went offline in 2011.
