"Surefield is the first residential real estate brokerage to dramatically lower commissions for U.S. homeowners by leveraging 3D home tours. The company developed a proprietary, virtual 3D home tour system using computer vision technology, giving buyers the most realistic, remote tour of a home, enabling a new level of commission savings with no trade-offs. Now sellers dont have to automatically pay a 3 percent buyers agent commission to get buyers into their home because Surefield is using 3D home-tour technology to get them into the home online.
