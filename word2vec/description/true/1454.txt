"iPosition is an insurgent in the $55 billion market for sensors that enable remote machine motion control.  From the broad range of robotics to fly-by-wire and drive-by-wire, to remote surgery...all are made possible by the sensors that feed back the vital position information that allow remote control of machine motion by computers and by man himself.  Very simply, every machine from a directional drill operating 10,000 feet underground to spacecraft above depend on the position sensors embedded in their control systems to function...and  iPosition's dynamic new technologies will lead the way.
