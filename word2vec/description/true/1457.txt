iPosition's Differential Phased Array Transducer (DPAT) Sensing Technology will transform the resolver market and ultimately the general rotary market.  DPAT sensors will be compact, disc-form angular sensors that lead in measurement performance while reducing weight, power consumption, and cost by 50 to 60%.
