TVRunway's API connects directly inside the online video player, allowing a site's users to click on clothes worn in the video and buy while watching. No plug-ins, downloads, video editing or tagging. Instead, TVRunway uses machine learning and comparative algorithms to identify items, then displays the top three, real-time matches from 300+ retailers' available inventories. This approach makes TVRunway instantly deployable and 100% scalable across all videos, no matter when they were made.
