Corpnet has built a team of partnerships and alliances with some of the leaders in scientific research, workforce development, as well as drone manufacturing and robotics developers in the industry.  Corpnet is working with 432d Wing Creech AF Base Nevada, Booz Allen & Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, Desert Research Institute (DRI), Doctor Paul Oh of Drexel University/UNLV and NIAS-UAS to accomplish our endeavors. Goals of this unsolicited government proposal are to underscore the potential rewards which include, but are not limited to the following: best price accommodations, the highest caliber consulting and business expertise spearheading efforts to fruition, re-infusing public trust and the entrepreneurial spirit  which is the backbone of industrialism in America. Our proposal to help the government by more effectively spearheading the commercialization of the UAS and its related efforts translates to a win-win.
