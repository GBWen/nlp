Detecting icons on a screen is a problem of knowing when the icon appears in the screen and how to capture it efficiently and accurately. Icon matching is the problem of efficiently matching a query icon (such as a low quality camera phone icon and/or photo taken from a screen) against a database of icons. eyeconit has created a core proprietary technology for icon detection and recognition with extremely high success rate out of millions of icons. Our technology works with a variety of different quality cameras. In addition, our robust matching and recognition system can handle pictures taken in real life conditions that may have lighting artifacts, focus/motion blur, perspective distortion etc. The technology works in a wide variety of real life scenarios including print advertisements, websites, iPhones, LCD screens and more."
