BiMeo story begins in 2009 when a first prototype is successfully tested with a hemiparetic patient. In late 2010 a positive international patent search report is issued for the invention of the BiMeo system. After that two more BiMeo prototypes are developed and tested in a preclinical study at the University rehabilitation institute - Soca. Several case studies have been conducted in cooperation with the Faculty of health science, UL.
