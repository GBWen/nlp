Your customers can take a picture of their room and Digital Bridge will automatically recognise the walls, floors, ceiling, objects and lighting conditions in the room. Your customers can then visualise what new wall/ floor decorations and furnishings will look like in their own room - without the need to print out any in-room markers."
