Founded by executives from ArcSight with deep domain expertise in enterprise security, PetaSecure leveraged the power and scale of Hadoop to deliver next-generation threat detection, investigation and response. Our focus was on finding and remediating emerging security problems that leverage user, application and data flaws to attack enterprises. Key innovations include adapting the machine learning and predictive analytics that have been successfully utilized in research, customer care, marketing, etc., to solve security problems. These breakthrough algorithms minimize the impact of successful attacks by reducing the threat detection time from weeks and months to seconds, enabling real time response.
