 The value proposition for our users is to: (1) facilitate the learner-mentor relationship to drive performance achievement in authentic learning environments; (2) generate meaningful, real-time informatics and analytics using machine learning of the data set to sort the signal from the noise on the internet to serve up content to help learners achieve their goals; and (3) stimulate sophisticated research through a massive, elegantly designed structured data set, evidence-based theoretical framework, and powerful learning system to examine and improve performance for our learners.
