"icClarity They founded icClarity, Inc. in May of 2014 based on growing demand for full-rate, full resolution 3D image capture that is unburdened by power hungry computations needed to resolve the correspondence issue associated with existing multi-sensor  3D systems today.  Their solution includes a single imager, an illumination source and an efficient firmware stack that processes the raw sensor data  to deliver usable 3D coordinates to an application layer via a user-friendly API.
