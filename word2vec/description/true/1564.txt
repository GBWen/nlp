"Secured OS with BiTSentry technology is a secured version of the Android operating system that prevents malware from performing any malicious functions such as accessing/stealing your personal data, using your device sensors like the camera or mic to spy on you, as well as causing performance issues when using strong encryption.  Unlike current solutions today that only patch over the problem or are only useful after the breach,  we are immunizing your device to defeat any attack in advance which is completely different.  Our approach weaves together hardening the operating system, virtualizing the actual application, managing the cryptography, using machine learning to detect unusual behavior and adding in our own custom security chip.
