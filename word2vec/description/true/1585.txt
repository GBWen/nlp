"The wearable device comes in two parts, a wristband and a back device, which can integrate into the back brace of a worker. The device has sensors, which coupled with our machine learning algorithms, can analyze the biomechanics of a worker during a lift and calculate their risk of injury. If the lift has a high risk of injury, workers get feedback on the wristband through a display, a red LED and a optionally, a light vibration.
