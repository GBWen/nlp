In fifteen research areas and research groups, eight competence centers and six Living Labs product features, prototypes and patentable solutions in the field of information and communication technology will be developed starting from application-oriented basic research. Funding is provided through tendering of public funding authorities such as the European Union, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi), the federal states and the German Research Foundation (DFG) as well as by development contracts from industry. The progress of publicly funded projects will be reviewed twice a year by an international expert panel (Scientific Advisory Board). As part of the five-yearly evaluation by the BMBF, DFKI in 2010 was again a very positive rating.
