DFKI receives funding from government agencies such as the European Union, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi), the German Federal States and the German Research Foundation (DFG) as well as from cooperation with industrial partners. Twice a year, a committee of internationally renowned experts, Scientific Advisory Board, audits the progress and results of publically funded projects. In addition, BMBF evaluates DFKI every five years.
