Hebi Robotics builds intelligent and connected building blocks for creating robotic solutions and uses these building blocks to deliver these solutions faster, better, and cheaper than current technology.  Well-defined interfaces, internet-enabled connectivity, and smart software tools allow implementers to spend their time focusing on the task at hand rather than low-level implementation details, resulting in faster development.  The flexibility and reconfigurability of these tools allow robotic solutions to be more appropriately customized for their tasks, resulting in better robots. Finally, these both result in solutions that are cheaper, both due to reduction in development time and because customization means that only necessary parts are purchased.
