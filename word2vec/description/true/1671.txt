"AIO Robotics is the next generation 3D printer company from Los Angeles, CA. We have developed the world's first All-In-One 3D Printer ZEUS that can scan, edit, and print 3D objects with the touch of a button. ZEUS has an integrated high-speed computer and a large touchscreen, thus it is a stand-alone device with powerful on-board features. The internet connectivity allows automatic updates, direct access to online 3D file databases, and industry-first customer support via the touch of a button. The machine comes ready out of the box, no calibration necessary, no connection to an external PC required. The initial setup time is less than 10 min.
