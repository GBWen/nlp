To|Someone uses machine learning to render the version of an email most likely to motivate. To|Someone applies a recommender engine to email, predicting which content will get the best result. The model is refined when the person takes action (click, unsubscribe, donate).  Our service focuses on getting more clicks, less unsubscribes and providing customers with actionable intelligence about their online universe.
