The integration most often used for our clients begins with EDI transfer of claim and provider records from the claims management system to our bill review system.IQReview captures this data and makes it available to the bill review analyst's production use. Importantly, IQReview tracks any unique identifiers used by the claims system and returns them as part of the next step, which is the EDI transfer of payments records back to the claims management system. This allows the claims management system to identify internal claim and vendor records associated with each payment with 100% accuracy and no manual intervention. Many organizations have a need to interface with multiple claims databases and even different claims systems simultaneously.IQReview supports this requirement and automatically segments claim and vendor records so that the user is only presented with records from the appropriate claims system during production.
