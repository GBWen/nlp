IQReview interfaces with all major claims management systems such as: David, David Renaissance, Risk Master, VOS, VOS Portal, Talisman, Sucaba, Pyramid, Stars, RiskCo, and Gensource. As we add new clients we continually build new interfaces to client specifications. The interface is provided via EDI (electronic data interface) to receive claims data and vendor data from an external system as well as transmit payment information to an external system. Payment information may include bill review fees, PPO fees and more broken down in whatever manner is appropriate to our customers' AP system.Additionally, IQReview provides data to claims systems in an EDI format to allow the printing of EOR information on check stubs.
