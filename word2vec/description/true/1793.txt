Aireal is an augmented reality platform that allows digital content to coexist with reality, creating infinite ways to experience our world. This proprietary method of anchoring digital content in defined Airspace, visible through mobile and wearable tech, provides experiential opportunities that have never before existed. The platform enables people to design, discover and experience 2D, 3D, Video and Interactive content super-imposed over their real world environment. Unlike the "current" augmented reality that requires marker-based recognition, Aireals patented (markerless) technology allows digital content to be anchored to real world longitude, latitude and altitude coordinates. In addition, we created a system to understand every outdoor environment in true 3D (our "Digital Mold") without the use of computer vision -- yielding the most realistic, un-interrupted AR experience that exists today and creating the perception that digital content really does coexist with reality.
