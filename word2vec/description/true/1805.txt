Located in the heart of Vermonts green mountains, in the picturesque village of Manchester Center, weve grown from a one-man operation into a team dedicated to providing accessibility solutions for all low vision computer users.  We have recently expanded our offices to include the sitecues team in Cambridge, MA, as well as the Window-Eyes team in Fort Wayne, IN.
