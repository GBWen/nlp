AKWs patent-pending technologies combine machine learning and optimization into the PALM (Petroleum Analytics Learning Machine) software product suite, which manages a set of applications named Machine Analytics Products (MAP) for multi-variant analysis of combined datasets from geology, geophysics, rock physics, reservoir modeling, drilling, hydraulic fracture completions, production and gathering for delivery to markets. PALM is more sophisticated than anything used in the petroleum industry today. For example, PALM predictive and optimization technologies use proprietary time-series shape recognition and real-time decision trees to automatically steer fracs to classifications that we invented, the combination of which over 10s of stages, is statistically more likely to produce high volumes of hydrocarbons and eliminate low producers, saving millions in operational costs, all in real-time.
