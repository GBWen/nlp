"The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) aims to construct AI systems with reasoning, learning, and reading capabilities in order to support AI research and engineering. The institutes projects include Aristo: a project involving a machine that contains large amounts of knowledge in machine-computable form that can answer questions, explain those answers, and discuss those answers with users; Semantic Scholar: a service for scientific literature search and discovery based on semantics and textual understanding; Euclid: a project focused on understanding and solving mathematical word problems and diagram-based geometry problems; and Plato:  a research project on visual knowledge extraction that aims to create knowledge bases comprised of information derived from images, both static and video.
