Aragorns mission is to solve the worlds most interesting data analysis problems, and bring the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to your browser and via a lightweight API. We also partner with the leading media companies to create interactive content that engages readers and encourages them to explore data far deeper than before, which takes storytelling to the new level. In addition, we provide a marketplace for the independent data scientists to publish interactive visualizations on our partners pages. Aragorn was founded in 2012 by a team that includes MIT trained computer scientists with experience building next generation data analysis platforms, such as Palantir.
