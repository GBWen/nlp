In December 2010, AutoScout research and development efforts shifted to the Advanced Digital Sciences Center (ADSC), a research arm of the University of Illinois in Singapore. The Semantic Analysis of Sports Video project was officially approved in August 2011. From August 2011 through Spring of 2014, the senior management team conducted research and development for AutoScout as well as other computer vision applications. Efforts resulted in, among other things, three different solutions for (American) football video analysis backed by one patent (pending), three technical disclosures, and eleven top conference and journal publications.
