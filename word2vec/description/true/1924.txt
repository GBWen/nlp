Caliber is a SaaS platform that unlike existing predictive sales tools, uses natural language processing and machine learning to build psychographic profiles on buyers that accelerate big and complex B2B deals (>$100K, >3 months buying cycle, multiple buyer personas). Caliber's proprietary persona modeling tech gives actionable insights on how to best communicate with buyers based on their persona - what content, writing style and tone-of-voice to use. Caliber is currently integrated with Salesforce & Marketo and is in beta with Citrix, SolidFire (NetApp), Return Path, Convercent and few other enterprises that are already seeing up to 40% lift in conversion using psych data.
