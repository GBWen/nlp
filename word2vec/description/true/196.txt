QPID is EHR agnostic, and automatically delivers context-sensitive information from patient records into point of care and care planning workflows. QPID drives higher clinician productivity and more informed care decisions, for improved patient outcomes and lower costs.  The QPID platform uses natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and a library of thousands of clinical concept searches designed to retrieve digests of clinical information that match how a clinician thinks.
