Dexter Industries was founded in 2010 by John Cole.  Like most great companies, it started on a kitchen table where kits and products were hand designed, hand assembled, and shipped to their customers.   After a few years of developing sensors for LEGO Mindstorms, he came up with the idea to connect LEGO Mindstorms with the Raspberry Pi single board computer. The idea was launched as a Kickstarter Project called the BrickPi and turned out to be quite successful.  Theyve been building robots for the Raspberry Pi ever since!
