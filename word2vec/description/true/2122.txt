Drizl solves the problem of "What should I do with this space".  It's an online art marketplace that lets users upload photos of their room so they can see how their art will look before they buy. It uses computer vision and UX tools to automatically calibrate rooms and show art accurately in situ.  It also uses machine learning to curate art collections to be size-appropriate and sensitive to preferences and characteristics of users and their rooms.
