"Emoshape is a UK startup company, setup and owned by Patrick Levy Rosenthal, which develops powerful emotional technology. The company was the first to create a prototype in which the projection of an image, a ball, could be seen 13 inches away from the screen and yet the user was able to hit the ball directly with their hand, without the need for any special equipment or interface. Emoshape continue to create products with the aim of increasing their users' interactive experience, the most recent being. The EmoSpark Cube is the first Artificial Intelligence console - it's a translucent, android powered Wi-Fi/Bluetooth cube that allows users to create and interact with an emotionally concise intelligence through conversation, music, and visual media. Over time, the cube creates a customized Emotional Profile Graph (EPG) which collects and measures a unique emotional input from the user. The EPG allows the cube to virtually feel senses such as pleasure and pain; and expresses those desires according to the user. Emo Spark will take not only gaming, but also your TV, smart phone or computer to an entirely different level from anything ever experienced before.
