TronMe software is a patented multimedia player, developed by EmoPlayer, using a proprietary interactive video and Interactive music audio format the IVS which appeared early 2006 in the United Kingdom. TronMe is a player which allows several actions on track and video; there are the different segments of the song; the verse, chorus, bridge, introduction and the different instruments used on each track are also separated; each track is broken down into bits. The user takes these building blocks and makes their own unique live video mix of the song.
