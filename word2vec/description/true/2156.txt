At Emoters, were developing tiny robots that seem alive. Emoters is based in Austin and is led by Dr. Bradley Knox, who researched human-robot interaction and artificial intelligence at the MIT Media Labs Personal Robots Group and at UT Austin. We cannot yet give details about what were making, but we cant wait to share our robots when theyre ready.
