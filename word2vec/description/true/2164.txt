They are developing software to enable Question-Answering for Enterprise and Business Intelligence (BI) applications, using sophisticated Natural Language Processing / Computational Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence techniques. According to Gartner, Natural Language Question Answering systems  currently exemplified by non-enterprise products such as Google, Siri, and IBM Watson  could soon be destined for the Enterprise domain as well. Gartner predicted that 70 percent of leading BI vendors would have incorporated natural-language capabilities by 2016, likely using technologies developed externally rather than by the BI vendors themselves. While this of course presents an enormous potential for disruption in the $13-billion BI market, there has yet to be a pervasive product offering in this regard. This is likely due to the significant technical challenges of applying traditional Q&A and search technologies to the unique technical environments of Enterprise. Their company focuses on addressing these challenges, and developing the underlying technologies that would enable the Enterprise Question-Answering applications of the future.
