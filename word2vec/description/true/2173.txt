As a cloud-based solution, Ersatz charges companies a per-minute usage fee whenever Ersatz is being ""trained"". For companies preferring unlimited usage and greater control, Ersatz offers its deep learning appliance. This solution includes hardware (specialized ""GPU"" number crunchers), the same Ersatz software as the cloud version, and the Ersatz source code so it can be audited and integrated more deeply into customers products."
