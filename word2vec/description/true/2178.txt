"Euraeka is a search, discovery and recommendation engine for textual content. In particular, it focuses on continuously aggregating news and other analytical content from publicly available sources. The collected content is ranked by an artificial intelligence engine and stored for efficient search and retrieval. The site presents two views - generic and personalized. The generic view is the front page, which presents the most important news for the day from all the sources we monitor, ranked by our algorithm. The personalized view is based on a recommendation engine that tracks user's reading habits and personalizes the content stream to each user's detected preferences. The recommendation engine continuously adapts itself to the changing user reading habits so that the recommendations are always relevant.
