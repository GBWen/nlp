"SelfScore is developing a strong market niche around providing access to financial products (credit cards, student loans, etc) to a deserving but underserved population of international students (1M+ strong and growing with $31 billion in untapped annual spending). International students are routinely granted access to the US educational system and all the advantages it has to offer. However, no clear path exists for them to gain access to the credit markets. The current credit policies handicap them, leaving them unable to get a credit card, student loan or car lease without paying exorbitant costs/fees. We want to provide them with a financial on-ramp and put them on a path towards financial success in America.
