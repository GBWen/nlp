Given their lack of credit history or credit score, (thin file, no file) we evaluate these students using alternate data science and machine learning methods, such as our own SelfScore, which measures creditworthiness using our proprietary data science framework/algorithms. We determine students ability to repay using such predictive attributes as education/major, cost of education, source of initial funding, future employability and objective measures (e.g. places, times, graphs) using our framework. We also determine their propensity to stay/leave the country using these attributes. Our compliance framework takes into consideration various federal regulatory constraints concerning KYC/CIP, Fair Lending, CDR, ECOA and FCRA. Seizing this 1M international student market will set the foundation for future product or market expansions into other thin file populations."
