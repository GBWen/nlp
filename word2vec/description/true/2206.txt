Exogensis is incentivizing and expanding synthetic biology research and development through web platforms and automated systems. ExoBioSys, our web based marketplace for synthetic DNA, provides a means for developers to buy and sell synthetic genomic code. We are also making the creation, validation, and research of newly developed synthetic organisms and parts easier and cheaper through automated systems and machine learning algorithms.
