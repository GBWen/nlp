EyeOnn is a smart solution that protects your swimming pool 24/7, using an underwater camera and computer vision algorithms. The system is easy to self-install, however an EyeOnn technician can also install it for you. The system is always activated and doesn't need to be switched on or off. It constantly monitors all activity in the water. The system detects when someone enters the water and it recognizes if a swimmer is in distress. For each one of these detections, the system sends customized alerts.
