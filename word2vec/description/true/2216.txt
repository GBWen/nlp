Our new analytics product  Contexxia  utilizes Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence techniques to make SEC filings research fast and easy. It enhances the conventional ability to analyze financial statements (numerics) by providing unique views of textual changes in corporate regulatory filings and implicit events that can be predicted based on these filings. It leverages the underlying XBRL data to provide rich analytics of textual semantics and XBRL concepts. Contexxia has social network integration enabling users to bookmark and share fragments of information from SEC filings with their social networks. Contexxia is also designed to incorporate a wide variety of external data sources beyond regulatory filings to provide a complete Big Data analytics platform.
