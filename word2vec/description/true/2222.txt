Falkonry's condition prediction makes IoT applications smarter. Falkonry provides a quick, easy, and cost effective method for adding pre-packaged machine learning for condition identification and prediction to IoT applications. Falkonry predictors can find hidden conditions such as performance degradations and anomalies from streams of time series data. Applications of such predictions include predictive maintenance, performance management, and failure prevention. Through simple APIs, it can be rapidly embedded into IoT application environments such as ThingWorx, Splunk, and others. No data science experts are needed and domain expertise can be easily added through its intuitive user interface. The service is deployable in the cloud or on premise.
