Five Elements Robotics is dedicated to transforming the human robot relationship. Their goal is to help launch the Era of Robotics, in which robots become a part of their everyday life. They envision robots being a part of the family unit, and integral to their society and mindset. They see families naming their robots, developing relationships with them, and counting on them to do many tasks that they either cant do, or dont want to do. To that end they have developed Budgee. A reasonably priced robot assistant who carries your things so you dont have to!
