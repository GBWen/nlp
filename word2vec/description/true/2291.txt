Gather empowers business communities to self-insure. Our coverage is offered through a captive which is owned by the businesses it insures. Over 90% of fortune 500 companies own a captive, but due to the complexity, less than 3% of small businesses own one. We bring business communities together so they can enjoy this same benefit."
