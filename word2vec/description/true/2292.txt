We are building first of its kind Automatic Virtual Reality Experience builder. To keep it simple, a 5 years old kid draws "two mountains and a sun in between" in a microsoft paint kind of application. We convert that into complete real world 3d models where you can experience it using Virtual Reality. That is the kind of technology that we are building. For a real estate builder/architect, a simple floor plan will be converted into a home with all the interiors and furniture where they can virtually walk inside. The technology involves a lot of expertise into 3D modelling, Modelling algorithms, Real time rendering, Computer vision and Virtual Reality.
