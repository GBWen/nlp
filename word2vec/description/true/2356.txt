Multi-tenant, AWS-hosted Microservices architecture for processing high-resolution natural images (unstructured scenes), extracting textual metadata via Computer Vision & Optical Character Recognition, and storing resulting metadata associations & resized media.  The system has both a receipt API (for initiating new processes) & a request API (to search/retrieve processed objects by their associated metadata).
