Hi-Park's solution is a smartphone application that runs in the background, capturing video from the rear camera of the smartphone that is fastened to any standard hands-free holding device. Using a cutting edge computer vision algorithm, the smartphone identifies empty parking spaces as the car heads towards its destination. The vacant parking GPS data is sent to a central server, where it is then distributed to all other Hi-Park users to enable them to find vacant parking spaces based on their need."
