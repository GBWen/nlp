The modular nature of HydroKite makes it an ideal platform for a wide scale of projects from individual units to IPP clusters.  A 1 km stretch of river can easily accommodate a 1MW project at a capital cost of $4/W and availability that is 3-4 times higher than typical photovoltaic and wind installations.  The average cost of electricity from such HydroKite projects is significantly below the average price of grid electricity in North America (12/kWh), offering substantial financial returns to individuals (net-metering) and IPPs alike.
