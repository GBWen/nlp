The HydroKite protects the environment by design.  Given our objective to harness energy as economically as possible from a river, we place HydroKite units where the stream flow is strongest.  In contrast, fish, such as salmon, like to swim where the stream flows are weaker.  This happy coincidence leads our units to have no impact on fish and fishing activities.  Finally, by avoiding any change in the natural flow of the stream or extensive structures on the streambed, we ensure that spawning grounds and the ecology of the river are unaltered.
