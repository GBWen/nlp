Immersive and Flexible: We offer our program in lieu of regular instruction during the school year or as summer enrichment camps, and so far over 2,000 students have engaged in i2 course activities such as building prosthetic fish tails and elephant legs, designing response plans to global epidemics, and engineering robotics solutions to industrial manufacturing challenges, as well as hundreds of other hands-on activities design to invent and inspire(from which i2 derives its name).  Each course is based on 25 hours of curriculum and is designed to run for 5 hours on each of 5 consecutive days.
