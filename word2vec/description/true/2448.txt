INNOVYA - Traceless Biometric System is using a fuzzy algorithm method/logic for identifying an individual through a biometric identifier that is designed to be non-unique. Fuzzy logic is a type of mathematic algorithms and programming that more accurately represents how the human brain categorizes objects, evaluates conditions, and processes decisions. Fuzzy logic allows an object to belong to a set to a certain degree or with a certain confidence. Instead of using unique biometric information, an amorphous identifier(s) agent is replacing it. The amorphous agent is an incomplete identifier obtained from a fresh scanned biometric information which is non-unique. Another alterable limit indicator(s) form a document can be added to overturn non-unique combinations to become unique. By incomplete or alterable we mean that the biometric information itself or the document cannot be reconstructed from the identifier(s) even with the device that originally allocated the agent or the Biometric Identifier Token. Using this method, the individual has to be present (with his document during the identification process since the (secret) token identifier itself has no true value except in a particular biometric identification transaction. This is important in order to avoid an association with recorded values or any other unique characteristic.
