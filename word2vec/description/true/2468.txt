"Founded in 2012, Inuitive is a fabless semiconductor company. Their product NU3000 is a multi-core signal processor chip aimed to support 3D Image Processing and Computer Vision (CV) processing. NU3000 is the most advanced and optimized ASIC as of today in the market of 3D imaging and smart sensor HUB. The NU3000 aims to support new applications where 3D depth and computer vision is required. It can operate as a stand-alone device (Smart 3D sensor HUB) or be embedded into existing solutions as a co-processor for image processing and CV. Inuitive is first and the only one to offer a dedicated and complete 3D image processing and CV co-processor. Inuitive co-processor off-loads the main processor, thus reducing system response time, saving power and increasing performance.
