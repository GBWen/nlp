Invenia uses its intelligence system to link forecasting, pattern recognition, and optimization together with a model of the decision-making process specific to each user. This results in a decision recommendation, which is the best answer to the problem that the user is trying to solve at any given time. For energy markets, this process involves understanding the problem from generation through transmission and finally to marketing. This simplifies operational decision making, while making use of smart grid data, and becoming more efficient as the frequency of decisions increases."
