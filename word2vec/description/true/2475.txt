Our primary focus is on Robotics R&D as well as manufacturing. We believe in paying a lot of attention to user-friendliness and aesthetics of the Robots that we design and it can be seen reflected in our products. Currently we are focused on design of the Minion Bot - The Industrial load carrying robot. Click on the link in the top menu bar to know more about it.
