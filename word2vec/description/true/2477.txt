We love teaching. We have to our credit an experience of four years in conducting workshops for engineering students and working professionals alike. Till date we have trained more then 1500 engineering students and have travelled more then 30,000KM across India to conduct these workshops. Our workshop on Raspberry Pi has been most popular one as well as the workshop on Internet of Things and Basic Robotics too are a great hit.
