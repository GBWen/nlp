"Jobcha is introducing a new platform that will provide a smarter job search. Utilising an innovative, unique, auto-machine learning algorithm our system will process data received from an online CV and other sources to provide members of our platform with insights into their employability. These insights include an expected salary based on their profile, tailored job vacancies that match their level of experience, and suggestions for how to improve their employability in order to compete for positions they are currently ineligible for.
