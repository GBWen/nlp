We use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to build a 3D CAD model of keys and identify key codes to a precision of 100 microns. Photos can have messy backgrounds and the camera can be slanted with respect to the key. Our algorithms can handle wear patterns on keys, specular reflections, bad lighting, fuzzy pictures, colored keys, angled perspective, and many other real-world artifacts.
