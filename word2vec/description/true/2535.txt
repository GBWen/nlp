Kinova Robotics was founded in part because of one man  the founders uncle, Jaco, a disabled inventor who created a manipulator for his wheelchair out of a hot dog pincher, some microswitches, and some complex electronics. This early attempt, while primitive, was the basis for a whole series of amazing  and amazingly useful  robotic arms.
