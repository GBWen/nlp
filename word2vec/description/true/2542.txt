KMel Robotics was founded in late 2011 by Alex Kushleyev and Daniel Mellinger, graduates of the University of Pennsylvania. They are experts in hardware design and high-performance control and they focus on developing research platforms that push the limits of experimental robotics. They develop everything from low-level hardware to complete systems, capable of autonomous operation.
