Every day, LeadScanr analyzes millions of public social media posts. Our software uses sophisticated language processing algorithms to find social media messages that express an intention to buy a certain product or service. We call these public posts leads, because they help businesses that provide relevant products or services reach out to the author of the message. We sort these leads into several industry categories to simplify the lead discovery process. With LeadScanr, we do all the hard work for you - all you have to do is start a conversation with your potential clients.
