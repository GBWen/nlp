Locogram brings all small to medium size women's clothing stores on to a single shopping platform. To do so we have developed a proprietary technology platform that uses advance machine learning techniques to automatically get all the products, categories and relevant product information from retailers' websites and create their dedicated storefronts on Locogram. Most importantly, these storefronts are automatically updated whenever the retailers update their websites.
