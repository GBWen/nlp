LucidAct Virtual Care Assistant is designed to make it easy for care teams to track at-risk patients, and coordinate timely actions with Intelligent Workflows. Beyond reminding the care manager to call the patient, Intelligent Workflows drive activities among care team members, the patient, and caregivers to complete the interventions - no one drops the ball, no patient falls through the crack. LucidAct also improves an at-risk patients outcome by engaging the patient to follow their personalized care plans. Over time, LucidAct will learn about the patient's behavior through powerful machine learning technology to optimize engagement. Both the care team and patients can interact with LucidAct Virtual Care Assistant via mobile devices 24/7.
