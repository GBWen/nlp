MEDISKOR brings advanced Machine Learning technology to medical practices to help them continually analyze past medical billing encounters, predict future medical bill payment performance, and identify key bill payment patterns that maximize financial performance. By analyzing data specific to your practice as well as analyzing bill payment performance data within your larger specialty, MEDISKOR is able to identify key patterns consistent with negative and positive reimbursement variances and patient bill payment outcomes. These new insights are then used to stream-line the process of maximizing the financial opportunities that come with both ICD-9 and ICD-10 code sets as well as revolutionize how practices bill and collect directly from patients. We offer medical practices our advanced technology over the internet as a service for a low fixed monthly price, freeing customers from complex software and hardware management and allowing practices to plan around a fixed monthly cost.
