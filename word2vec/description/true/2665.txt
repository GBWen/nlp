Mind Leap is a living map of the field of education apps for kids, publishing reviews of education apps in 3 categories + overall: educational value, engagement factor and shelf life. For parents and teachers, Mind Leap puts a spotlight on the apps that are doing it right. For developers, we identify gaps in offerings and opportunities for individual apps to be more educational and engaging. We help apps that are truly educational get the market attention they deserve.
