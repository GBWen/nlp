The Machine Learning Conference (MLconf) began in 2012, as a partnership with Carnegie Mellon Universitys GraphLab team, to gather the thought leaders in Machine Learning, specifically Graph Databases.. In 2013, MLconf became a separate event, devoted to the Machine Learning and Data Science community in San Francisco, agnostic of any tool, platform or company. MLconf events host speakers from various industries, research and universities to discuss recent research and application of Machine Learning methodologies and practices. Since 2014, MLconf has hosted events in several US cities and has aimed to host gender balanced rosters of presenters from experts in Machine Learning, Data Science and AI.
