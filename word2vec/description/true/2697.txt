Using the Companys solution helps fleet operators significantly improve their bottom line, safety, up time and carbon footprint by automatically monitoring tires for health issues such as under inflation, wear, tear, foreign objects, asymmetry, over heating, wheel alignment and more. The system can even detect stolen and incompatible tires, and all this without installing any component on the vehicle or tires, and without any disturbance to the work routine."
