The Neurorobotics Research Laboratory (NRL) is located at the Beuth-Hochschule fr Technik Berlin. They develop and research morphologies and distributed neural systems for autonomous robots. They are interested specifically in adaptive and robust behaviors. Adaptive here means that the behaviour can adapt to the environment and to the body of the robot. Therefore, it is essential that robots are allowed to move freely within a real Environment (which in technical jargon is called Embodiment and situatedness).
