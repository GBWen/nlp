Target applications of OpenPilot developments include civil and humanitarian uses where search and rescue capabilities afforded by guided aerial platforms can be of immense value; academic uses for research; stabilized platforms for aerial photography; as well as DIY hobbyists looking to do a little flying and have some fun. The OpenPilot platform includes support for multirotors, helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. However, the OpenPilot platform is flexible and can be adapted to diverse needs such as unique aircraft, marine, and ground vehicles. Being an Open Source project, the code is freely available for modification to suit unique needs.
