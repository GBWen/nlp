OpenPilot is an ideal platform for researchers and hobbyists working on aerial robotics or other mobile vehicular platforms where stabilization and guidance are required. OpenPilot brings the cost down to reasonable prices so people can focus on developing and refining applications rather than paying the extremely high prices of most commercial offerings, or having to do from the ground up hardware development."
