Businesses care so much about your feedback that they are assigning codes (called OPIs) to their products and services in order to get specific opinions about each of them. To start giving feedback you just need to enter the OPI code of the thing or person you want to give your opinion about. For instance, if you want to send us your opinion about our service, just type the OPI code OPINATOR and youll be instantly taken to the feedback screen.
