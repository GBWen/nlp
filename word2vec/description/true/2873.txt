Plament is an abbreviation for "Planet Management". Our Software monitors 24/7/365 picked information channels like news websites, political instances and financial institutions. Plament quantifies the observed Information/Events. Because of the Quantification we have a decent representation of our real world entities, events and relationships. It turns the Plament database into a playground for Data-Science and allows us to implement various machine learning algorithms on the database. This in turn gives us many possibilities to understand and predict future relationships or events and their outcome. We could also simulate certain relationships (e.g. between institutions or governments) or events.
