Playpower was founded with support from the MacArthur Foundation to help bring high-efficacy learning games to low-cost computers around the world (pop tech video). After building an incredible student team (at Carnegie Mellon and DAIICT in India), They began building online games to target high-impact skills like "number sense". Together, They won the National STEM Game Competition and the Marvel Educational App Grand Challenge! After conducting several classroom efficacy studies and building out games to support the Common Core, Their app "Fraction Planet" was one of the winners of an educational app competition by the NYC Department of Education. They work extensively with classroom teachers, educational researchers and kids -- and They are truly excited to share Their unique blend of learning science, game design and machine learning with students around the world!
