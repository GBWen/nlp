Quintus Corporation was a Silicon Valley start-up founded in 1984 as a Prolog compiler company in the Artificial Intelligence "non-market" of the 1980s. Acquired by Intergraph in 1989 for use in Expert Systems, Quintus then pivoted into the early CRM market (along with Vantive, Scopus, Clarify and others) and following a management buyout in 1995 pivoted again to focus on multi-channel Internet-enabled Contact Centers, acquiring Nabnasset, Acuity, and Mustang to expand the Quintus eContact product. Quintus successfully went public on NASDAQ in November 1999 as a leading "eCRM" vendor during the first Internet heyday. Following a corporate failure involving financial restatements in October 2000, Quintus was acquired by Avaya Inc. in April 2001 where the Quintus product became Avaya Interaction Center, a comprehensive omnichannel contact center solution deployed by over a thousand large organizations.
