The COTSBot from the Queensland University of Technology can identify the starfish using machine learning and low power computers. Because most of the hunting technology is built into the robot the COTSBot doesnt have to connect to the surface as it hunts and when its ready to exterminate it simply injects a chemical called thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar that destroys the fish, resulting in discolored and necrotic skin, ulcerations, loss of body turgor, accumulation of colourless mucus, loss of spines [and] large, open sores that expose the internal organs.
