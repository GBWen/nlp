RB Robotics is a changing it's business.  They  will be offering one last run of 50 units of the original style units.  This will deplete Their inventory of the components that can no longer be obtained easily (SC-01A Voice chip, INS8073, Etc)  They will continue to offer chassis, however, They are looking to update the electronics and move in to this millennium!
