At the Reconfigurable Robotics Lab, we focus on design, actuation, fabrication, and control of unique robotic systems. The research in the lab is committed to inventing interactive robotic systems with novel fabrication techniques and integration processes that push the limits of mechanical properties. These efforts enable creating self-reconfigurable origami robots that are highly conscious of the environment and have extensive applications in household appliances, rehabilitative therapy, and architectural tools
