To meet U.S. federal regulations, transmission pipeline operators within the U.S. are currently required to patrol over 400,000 miles of pipeline, at intervals ranging from once every two weeks to once per year.  On average, every day, somewhere within the U.S., enough pipeline to run between Seattle to Los Angeles is patrolled.  These patrols, which are primarily looking for construction encroachment and obvious signs of leakage, are currently conducted on foot, in a vehicle, or most commonly, by a manned aircraft.
