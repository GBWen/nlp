Remote Insights machine learning software and business processes automation streamlines the detection of construction encroachment and obvious signs of leaks in pipeline right-of-way, using inexpensive, commercially available space-based imagery.  Remote Insights approach results in a more timely detection of hazardous conditions, and by leveraging the relatively inexpensive distributed computing horsepower of the cloud, Remote Insights approach also offers a more thorough analysis of the imagery resulting in detection and prediction of more subtle hazards.
