Robai Corporation develops lightweight robotic systems that transcend traditional robotics through advanced software. Robai's premier Cyton line of kinematically redundant robotic manipulators have more dexterity and a larger workspace that is enabled through powerful inverse kinematics algorithms. With Cyton robots, it is easy for any user to script complex motions, apply autonomous sensing procedures, or teleoperate from remote locations-all while automatically dodging collisions with the environment and optimizing joint placement for accuracy and strength. It is through Robai's close connection with robotic software provider Energid Technologies that this capability is possible. Robai has licensed exclusive (for the Cyton weight class) access to Energid's software developed for some of the world's most advanced robotic missions.
