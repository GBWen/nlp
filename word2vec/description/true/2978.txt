The RoboEarth Cloud Engine (also called Rapyuta) makes powerful computation available to robots. It allows robots to offload their heavy computation to secure computing environments in the cloud with minimal configuration. The Cloud Engines computing environments provide high bandwidth access to the RoboEarth knowledge repository enabling robots to benefit from the experience of other robots
