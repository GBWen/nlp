 Robotics Design is a pioneer in the field of modular robotics, and was established with the release of ANAT (Articulated Nimble Adaptable Trunk), a ground-breaking robotic technology. It has given birth to a family of robots which serve the duct cleaning and industrial manipulating markets. This technology allows virtually any robotic system to be formed from identical modules, and allows the modules to be reconfigured to form a different robot to perform another application. ANAT technology simplifies and reduces the cost of manufacturing and repairing robots, while increasing their structural durability and dexterity.
