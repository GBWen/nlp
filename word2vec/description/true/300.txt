MetaLINCS was founded to address the growing problem of intelligently finding important information within email repositories. Email has become the cornerstone of business communications and organizations. The automatic capture of email communication in messaging systems creates a natural record of critical messages, context of important decisions and inherent communication patterns. Consequently, organizations are spending billions of dollars on email analysis, often as part of an investigatory discovery process or EDiscovery. Current technologies and traditional methods do not leverage the unique qualities of electronic messaging and hence do not adequately address this issue. The application of single techniques such as keyword search, knowledge management, databases or natural language processing are not sufficient. What is required is an intelligent combination of multiple technologies.
