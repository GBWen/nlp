The Robotics & Mechanisms Laboratory at UCLA is a facility for graduate and undergraduate robotics research and education with an emphasis on studying humanoid robots and novel mobile robot locomotion strategies. Their research interests are in the area of Robot Locomotion & Manipulation, Soft Actuators, Platform Design, Kinematics and Mechanisms, and Autonomous Systems. RoMeLa is also active in research based international robotics competitions winning numerous top prizes including the 'DARPA Urban Challenge' (3rd place, $500,000 prize), the international autonomous robot soccer competition 'RoboCup' (First Place in both the Kid-Size and Adult-Size Humanoid divisions, World Champions three times in a row, and brought the prestigious 'Louis Vuitton Cup Best Humanoid Award' to the United States for the very first time) and most recently being one of the six Track A teams chosen to participate in the disaster response robot competition 'DARPA Robotics Challenge' for the $2M top prize.
