SGROOM is developed to match rental seekers and landlords of Singapore in an highly efficient way. As there are already so many property websites in Singapore, users find it especially time consuming and tedious to navigating from website to website to search for a rental. Our spiders crawl local forums and classified websites to collect rental advertisements in real-time. After that, we use natural language processing techniques to extract region and transportation information from the collected advertisements. The classified rental advertisements are display in our website www.sgroom.com. Furthermore, users can subscribe to properties in their interested regions and nearest MRT stations on our website. Our system automatically matches landlord to subscribed rental seekers and that's what we call P2P rental seeking.
