Since our inception in 1999, SIFT has grown by over 30% per year (CAGR), and now has offices in Minneapolis, Boston, D.C., Dallas, and San Diego.  We collaborate with top research labs (DARPA, ONR, ARL, AFRL), and we team with top academics and industrial researchers to advance the state of the art and address cutting edge problems.  We work in domains from satellites to submarines; PTSD to provably-correct plans."
