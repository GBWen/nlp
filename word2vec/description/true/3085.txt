Clark founded Silver Bullet Technology in 1997, and began providing contract application development services to companies in the item processing industry. Over the next two years, Silver Bullet made its mark by assisting in the design of NCR's WiseIP interface, writing WiseIP software for NCR to drive 779X transports, and providing WiseIP training to NCR support group and resellers. During that time, Silver Bullet also collaborated with NCR and developed its first product a 7780 simulator. That product, now known as IP Simulator, is currently being used by most NCR resellers in the United States, making NCR Silver Bullet's largest customer.
