Silver Bullet furthered industry knowledge in 2002 by releasing a report comparing CAR/LAR engines, and continued to release products throughout the year. Ranger was enhanced to support Panini MyVision X, 20 and 50 transports, and an advanced version of Bullet OCR was developed using a patented Silver Bullet technology. Most notably, Silver Bullet developed and released several brand new products. Sidewinder was introduced for A2iA, Parascript, IBM CAR/LAR, Orbograph, Mitek and Unisys SoftCAR+ engines. Silver Bullet partnered with Panini NA and CheckTech to create the reject repair productMICR Mend and MICR Patch. Silver Bullet also partnered with Unisys and Firstar/US Bank to develop Chameleon, a product that allows Unisys applications to run unchanged on non-Unisys transports.
