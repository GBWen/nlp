Sinavo allows students to create personal social profiles through which they can post questions and interact with other students and teachers. Artificial intelligence performance metrics are in place so that the performance of every student in the trial exams and games provided by the platform can be monitored and compared. The necessary guidelines for improvement are then communicated to them.
