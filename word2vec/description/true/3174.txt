sportsQ is an Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based Sports Information and Social Media platform. It provides both Daily and season long Fantasy Sports Players, avid Sports Fans and those who wager on Sports, the ability to query for complex Sports Statistics and Information. For example, a User can query Give me the top 7 QBs in the NFC who lead in TDs, passing yards and interceptions in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and have the result immediately returned.
