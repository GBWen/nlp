Synapse Technologies provides Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS) solutions to meet varied requirements of customers. The concept of RaaS implies the use of robots for performing some of the easy yet important tasks for people, for instance a Robotic-Butler for delivery services to hotel rooms, a Robotic-Waiter in restaurants for food delivery to tables or even as a surveillance system. We envision a world where robots aid people in improving their quality of life. At Synapse Technologies, we are constantly working towards developing RaaS solutions towards a better future.
