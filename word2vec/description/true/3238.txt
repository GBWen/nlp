True real-time optimization is achieved through a fully transparent and controllable automation tool called Sonar which allows the advertiser to model their marketing rules, processes, and KPI's in a sophisticated trigger system. With this, TapHeaven is able to eliminate wasted ad spend on under-performing campaigns by automatically optimizing campaigns every second of every day. Second, TapHeaven leverages its sophisticated machine learning algorithms which are receiving performance data from the advertiser and ad exchanges in real time in order to accurately predict the lifetime value of each mobile user and optimize every bid to maximize the profit and ROI of every ad purchased.
