"TASVideos is an online community dedicated to creating and publishing tool-assisted speedrun videos and emulator assisted run-throughs that resemble superhuman-like playing sessions of classic and modern video games. Its emulators allow users to undo mistakes, make slow-motion gameplay, and even in some cases utilize robots to do its bidding.
