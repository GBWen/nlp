"The Bionics Lab at UCLA is a research group aiming to develop science, technology, and human resources at the interface between robotics, biological systems, and medicine. The goal is to produce useful, innovative research and technology as well as trained researchers fluent in both science, engineering, biological systems, and robotics. The primary research fields of the Bionics Lab are medical robotics and biorobotics including surgical robotics, and wearable robotics as they apply to the following fields: control, human motor control, neural control, human and brain machine interfaces, motor control rehabilitation (stroke), brain plasticity, haptics, virtual reality, teleoperation, biomechanics (full body kinematics and dynamics as well as  soft/hard tissues biomechanics).
