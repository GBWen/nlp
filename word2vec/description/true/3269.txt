Ticos technology is based on learning your spending patterns and notifying you about anomalies. With three simple steps, you can add your credit cards, educate Tico about your spending patterns, and contact your bank in case of any disputes. Each transaction is categorized as either blue, yellow, or red. Red indicates suspicious transaction that requires your immediate action; yellow means theres a warning regarding the transaction, and blue indicates the transaction is normal. If a transaction is marked as suspicious, Tico will tell you why it is suspicious. You can further educate Tico by verifying (swiping right) or reporting unfamiliar transactions (swiping left).
