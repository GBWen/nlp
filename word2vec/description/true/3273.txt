Tier5s first consumer product, TODO, is a modernized version of the to-do list that analyzes each of the users tasks using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies in order to find the right people within the users network who can support each task. Tier5 does not just use keyword search, but with advanced technologies it is able to understand the sub-tasks that go into an end goal. For example, when a user adds, write a book to TODO, Tier5 will be able to break down the sub-tasks of finding an editor, landing a publisher, and all the other intermediary steps.
