The wearable sensor is worn vaginal overnight and determines the core temperature every hour. It regularly transmits the values via a wireless connection to a gateway, which passes it on to a server. On the server it is processed and provided for the users mobile app.  Thus, the one and only relevant value can be identified easily: it is the lowest value measured overnight. In comparison to the other values taken the nights before, ovulation can be identified very securely and with our mature machine learning system, we are able to predict the exact timing of ovulation closer the more data we receive. The gateway serves as a safe and discrete storage box for the sensor also."
