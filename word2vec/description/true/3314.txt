TwitterMining.com derives data through the twitter api to derive data and subsequently consumes the information via a proprietary natural language processing algorithm.  The result is a corpus of terms and hashtags surrounding the user's keyword accompanied by some useful metrics.  The free results provide the top 25 key terms and hashtags with frequencies.  The paid version ($2) provides the top 50 terms and hashtags with user ids, tweet count per user, time trending and the individual tweets.  Subscription service will provide bi-weekly updates delivered via email on a set of keywords for a fixed price.
