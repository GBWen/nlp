Ubiant can especially draw on its unique expertise in managing complexity and contingencies based on the multi-agent system technology (MAS) and artificial intelligence. Just like a colony of ants, a multi-agent system is conducive to producing a collective form of intelligence due to the interaction between a sufficiently large number of non-intelligent elementary entities acting within a close radius of each other. Ubiants intelligent building block is the end result of 10 years of research and development by a team of eight researchers, most of whom hold doctorates in distributed artificial intelligence reactive or cognitive MAS systems.
