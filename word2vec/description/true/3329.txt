"Union Crate is a machine learning platform that connects multiple foodservice applications using our open API. Our goal is to solve the loss of revenue and food waste problem in the USA by focusing on the main cause; inefficient management and lack of communication along the supply chain. We aggregate data from individual task-specific applications like ordering/invoicing, POS systems, inventory, and delivery into one simple dashboard and one login. Our machine learning tools process this aggregated data and automate tasks for our software partners and end user.  The end user can communicate with our platform and input requests via text messaging, or directly on our dashboard.
