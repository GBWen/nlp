Our technology automatically discovers the temporal boundaries of the videos contextually coherent video segments (CCVS). A CCVS is a temporal part of the video during which only one topic has been discussed and can be used to describe the theme of this part of the video. A CCVS may or may not contain any visual changes. Moreover, Video Semantics technology automatically assigns textual tags to each CCVS such that these keywords contextually describe the theme of the topic discussed in this part of the video. Video Semantics technology enables a multitude of applications such as sophisticated video indexing and search, and contextual media delivery.
