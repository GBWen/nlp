While sensors placed throughout the power plant generated extremely complex datasets, it proved impossible to close the performance loop and analyze them efficiently. Researchers solved this problem by developing of a pure software solution that reduces the datasets footprint without losing any of its granularity or complexity. Recognizing the universal value of the solution, Siemens AG, established Panoratio as a separate, independent entity.
