Wevolve solves the biggest problem in business today: getting people to change the way they work.  Employees use our interactive, constantly-personalising, emotion-rich coaching app to build and embed new working habits.  Leaders use our data feeds to get real-time x-ray vision into their human assets.   Behind the scenes, we use deep machine learning to constantly improve the effectiveness of our product and to find out whats really driving work effectiveness across different populations, organisations and geographies.
