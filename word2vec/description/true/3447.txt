Channel owners can donate a specified % of the revenue earned from their subscribers to a nominated charity, or for general charitable distribution.  The amount that they donate could be anything between 0% and 100% - it's totally up to them.  XTRER then adds a bonus by donating to these charities a figure between 10 and 100% of the profit that they earn from each channel subscriber.
