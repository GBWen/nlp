Channel owners submit their daily content messages to the XTRER platform by a variety of methods.  Some choose to log into their accounts from their desktop PCs, others choose to originate their content by text message, whilst others can automatically submit their content using the XTRER API.  In all cases, these content messages are carefully checked for inappropriate wording before being sent to the mobile phones of channel subscribers.  'Spamming' subscribers with multiple messages is not possible, since the XTRER platform restricts sending to a single message per day.
