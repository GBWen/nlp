Consumers describe what they need done and specify when and where their job should take place.  Using patent-pending machine learning and semantic technology, Redbeacon determines the best local service providers for the job.  If matched, service providers get notified by email and text message and are given the opportunity to submit a price quote.  Consumers can then select and book appointments with their top choice service provider based on a comparison of business profiles, price quotes, and ratings and reviews from past Redbeacon consumers.
