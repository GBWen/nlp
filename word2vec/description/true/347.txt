For service providers, Redbeacon may represent a better value proposition than other online marketing options because it is free to create skill profiles and receive job leads.  Service Providers only pay a small commission when they win a job, which minimizes the risk of wasted marketing dollars.  Redbeacon is also useful for service providers who wish to offer long-tail services or services at irregular times, such as nights and weekends.
