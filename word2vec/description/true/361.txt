"At Civil Maps, they believe that efficient, safe mobility can revolutionize the way they live and change how they interact with the world around us. To reach this future, they are building artificial intelligence that allows automobiles to perceive and respond to the physical world. Their first milestone is generating continental-scale HD 3D maps and real-time, centimeter level localization. Their process of questioning established methods and their artificial intelligence expertise allow us to define the mobility solutions of the future.
