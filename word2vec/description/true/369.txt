"OspreyData was founded within the Frost Venture Partner incubator. OspreyData harnesses the mass of sensor data generated by modern, high-value mechanical assets to predict and prevent failures, reduce downtime, and enhance operating efficiency. OspreyData analyses sensor data in real time using machine learning to continuously improve the insights and predictions it generates. By supplementing these capabilities with a full decision modeling platform OspreyData can produce accurate operational decisions to deliver optimal value from your high-value mechanical assets while preventing outages and accidents.
