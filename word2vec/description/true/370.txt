OspreyData provides a missing layer in the architecture of modern mechanical systems. Existing control systems are unable to tap into the predictive insights hidden within the mass of sensor data generated by complex machines from jet turbines to oil platforms. OspreyData is a physical systems intelligence platform that operates alongside traditional monitoring, process control, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) to deliver deep, predictive insights into the behavior of complex mechanical systems. These insights drive the operation, servicing and management of these critical assets."
