Recursion Pharmaceuticals is combining high-throughput experimental biology, bioinformatics, and machine learning to rapidly identify new indications for many known drugs and shelved assets.  Their  focus initially is in the orphan disease space, but their core technology has exciting applications in oncology, infectious disease, and inflammation.  Their system will allow them to bring their partners shelved assets to market for new indications at pennies on the dollar compared to traditional drug discovery approaches.
