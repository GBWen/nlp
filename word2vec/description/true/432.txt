To do so, Nuubo has a platform known as nECG DYNAMIC PLATFORM, which makes it easier to perform and read an electrocardiogram remotely. Specifically, the system patented by Nuubo is made up of three elements: a biomedical garment that allows the electrocardiogram signal to be captured without interfering with the patients daily activity; a device that continuously records the information captured by the garment and which also allows the data to be sent wirelessly and in real time for processing; and analysis and visualization software that, using artificial intelligence algorithms, can interpret all of the information transmitted by the wireless device.
