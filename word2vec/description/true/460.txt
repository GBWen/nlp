Mulu is the world's first deep learning platform built specifically to identify millions of commercially available products, however and wherever they're mentioned online. Publishers and bloggers use Mulu to automatically offer the products they mention for sale on the page. Ad platforms use Mulu to show target ads and build user interest graphs. Retailers and curation sites use Mulu to automate their affiliate links around the web and organize their inventory into thousands of curated collections on the fly.
