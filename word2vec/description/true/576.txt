RE2 Robotics, located in Pittsburgh, PA, is a Carnegie Mellon spin-off. We were founded in 2001 by Jorgen Pedersen on the principles of developing innovative robotic technologies that save lives and improve quality of life. Our team designs mobile manipulation technologies that enable robot users to remotely interact with the world -- whether on the ground, in the air, or underwater. Our intuitive systems are easy to operate and enable users to remotely perform dangerous tasks. Our main customer is the Military and over 400 of our robotic arms have been deployed overseas for EOD missions.
