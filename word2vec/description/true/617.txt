Founded as a professional services firm, JumpTime began by offering strategic engagement and traffic optimization consulting to some of the largest and most influential media companies. The idea to develop a platform emerged as their founders (who have real-world experience managing and growing online audience engagement for companies like MTV, Nickelodeon, Virgin Interactive, Unilever and Yahoo!) realized they could best use their insights by turning their tools over to their clients. Their clients could then apply these insights to their daily operations.
