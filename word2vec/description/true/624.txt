 The technologies which Biodico has developed are ready for commercialization and include (1) feedstocks (algae, jatropha, brassicas and others), (2) process control (the use of automation, remote sensing, Fourier Transform Near Infrared and Wave Guided Radar), and (3) a distributed neural network for centralized command, control and support for decentralized facilities. Biodico's technology is uniquely suited for multiple feedstocks, fast and inexpensive modular construction and deployment, enhanced throughput with reduced operating costs, and increased monetization of renewable fuel and energy incentives.
