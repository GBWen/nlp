RainBird is a cloud-based artificial intelligence platform that enables anyone to capture their knowledge and publish it so that others can solve problems.Creating a powerful knowledge base in RainBird is easy. RainBird will then use reasoning to help users solve a wide range of problems efficiently. It learns more simply by being used and can solve problems beyond those the author visualised.Each knowledge base can easily be added to a website or incorporated into software or mobile apps via a REST API. The first release will be available to those with only basic programming skills. Future versions will be accessible to everyone.RainBird is not just a tool for creating knowledgebases. It represents a new technology eco-system and more on this will be revealed in time. RainBird also has a big social enterprise component and the vast majority of users will be able to use it for free including schools and universities.
