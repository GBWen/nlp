Flashback Technologies has developed a machine learning framework for the real-time analysis of physiological data. We use novel and proprietary machine learning techniques to extract and analyze large amounts of complex physiological data. This work has led to the discovery of several previously hidden hemodynamic relationships that are predictive of acute blood loss, and the development of a patent-pending platform technology for the real- time analysis of human vital sign data.
