We think so. Which is why we've built our Content Marketing Software Framework- Marketing.AI- to organize your whole team, providing them with all the tools they need on one single guided track. To enable you to easily build an editorial calendar, to define personas, to manage your themes, to collaborate with your colleagues, and to understand what is working, and what isn't. You might even start to wonder if the AI in Marketing.AI really stands for Artificial Intelligence :)
