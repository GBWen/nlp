At CreditVidya we believe in the power of alternate data and technology to help lenders make more accurate credit decisions. Our mission is simple: To enable access to fair and transparent credit to 800 million un-scored Indians. We are a bunch of engineers with a sole mission to enable access to fair and transparent credit to 800 million+ un-scored Indians. Traditional methods of credit assesment have failed miserably in India. These outdated methods only look at the repayment history of individuals to give them a credit score. We at CreditVidya are harnessing the power of big data and advance machine learning techniques to re-imagine and re-build credit scoring.
