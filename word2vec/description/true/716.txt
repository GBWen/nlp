"Sitebots develops flying robots and charging stations that create high-resolution photographs and video clips from the air. The use of the charging station with automated battery exchange also enables non-stop monitoring and offers the possibility of real-time video transmission to any location. On request, a satellite or radio-based control unit allows spontaneous and individual reconnaissance flights to anywhere within the flight radius. The control can be made from any location with internet access.
