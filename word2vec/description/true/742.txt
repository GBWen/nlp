An earlier platform created a new way for pro athletes to connect with their fans via a unique one-to-N messaging feature.  Athlete profiles were generated by aggregating player news, statistics, tweets, and highlights from across multiple pro leagues.  Fans could communicate directly with players that claimed their profiles in a new way designed specifically for the pro athletes.  In 2014, more NHL players used Shnarped's app than used Twitter to communicate with hockey fans.
