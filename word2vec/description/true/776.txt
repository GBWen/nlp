VisiTrend makes powerful analytics easier to use through interactive visualization. Several analytics are included with an initial focus on cyber security. We have both a SaaS offering and a virtual appliance that can be setup on-site. VisiTrend connects to several different data stores including relational databases and big data solutions such as Hadoop. Users can interact with a visualization to run machine learning algorithms on their data without writing a line of code. Social features enable users to share analytics, data, and visualizations.
