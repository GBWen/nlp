Founded in 1990 by roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, iRobot designs behavior-based, artificially intelligent robots. iRobot's products are designed to navigate through complex and dynamic real-world situations, from maneuvering around furniture to searching abandoned buildings. Their robots are highly sophisticated, yet practical and easy to use.
