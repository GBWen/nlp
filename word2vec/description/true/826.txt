HEROZ, Inc. was founded in 2009 and our engineer has developed the most cutting edge artificial intelligence, Ponanza programme to play Japanese chess 'Shogi', which defeated an active professional player in a public match for the first time ever, in March 2013. Shogi presents a higher degree of complexity than many other strategy games, and has been of interest to Artificial Intelligence researchers.
