AdmitHub uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to facilitate the path to and through college.  Specifically, we've developed Oli, a chatbot that combines AI with human experts to provide free college guidance to all students.  For our college partners, AdmitHub eliminates repetitive tasks, helps colleges meaningfully engage students at scale, and provides deep insights into their pipeline of prospects.
