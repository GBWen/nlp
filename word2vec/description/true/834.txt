"KJAYA Medical's mission is to support clinicians in implementing patient care through storage, and diagnostic-medical-scan rapid access via Intelligent Visualization anytime, anywhere over the Internet. Their vision is to embody observable 3D anatomical structures and computer aided diagnoses as inherent components of diagnostic workflows and ubiquitously to be accessible over the web. Medical scans consist of large files which existing technologies, including conventional cloud, fail to manipulate easily, requiring diagnostic-quality compromises. By advancing innovation, utilizing artificial intelligence algorithms running on powerful distributed Graphics Processing Unit-based storage servers, KJAYA Medical has overcome medical-scan-management challenges, to deliver now the next generation Cloud 3D PACS RIS solution that is fast, accurate and affordable.
