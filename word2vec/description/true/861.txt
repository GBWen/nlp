Yebol is a semantic "decision" search engine that has developed a knowledge-based search platform. Based in San Jose, CA, Yebol's artificial intelligence human intelligence-infused algorithms automatically cluster and categorize search results, web sites, pages and contents that it presents in a visually indexed format that is more alligned with initial human intent. Yebol uses association, ranking and clustering algorithms to analyze related keywords or web pages. Yebol presents as one of its goals the creation of a unique "homepage look" for every possible search term.
