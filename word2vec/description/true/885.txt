Based on over 20 industry collaborations, it is very realistic to expect, at a minimum, CoRE can reduce preclinical attrition 5%, preclinical costs 20% and lead optimization costs 40%. When these three parameters were adjusted in a recent assessment of pharmaceutical R&D productivity (Paul et al. 2010 ) to capture the effects of using CoRE, this translated to capitalized costs savings of $238 million and out-of-pocket cost reductions of $88 million.  Additionally, CoRE can quickly yield significant reductions in time which may be instrumental in gaining first mover IP advantage, particularly with novel targets.
