They use machine learning, artificial neural networks and deep learning combined with the power of parallel computing to process and understand images how a human eye does. This enables Their intelligent algorithms to solve the complex real-world problems like identifying the target objects in complex images with cluttered backgrounds, varying lighting conditions, and varying object distances etc. while ignoring whats not contextual. With GPU, They are able to process huge amount of visual data in real time, in parallel matching that to huge internet size image database of related and relevant products to deliver the best results."
