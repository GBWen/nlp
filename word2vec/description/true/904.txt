"EqsQuest is a semantic search company, recently launched symbolab, a web search engine for math and science.  It allows users to search for equations, formulas and expressions using mathematical symbols and scientific notations as well as full text search.   The stated goal of the site is to provide the most relevant search results that are theoretically and semantically similar, rather than visually.  This is done, partly, by applying proprietary machine learning algorithms in order to understand the meaning and context of the search queries.  The methods used enable the classification and tagging of millions of equations and formulas.  Symbolab indexes the full text and equations of online encyclopedias, dictionaries, academic publications, lectures, books and more currently covering mathematics, physics and chemistry.
