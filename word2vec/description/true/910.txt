Positronics Incorporated provides our clients with unsurpassed service, support and expertise. We achieve this by communicating directly with you to understand your needs and your requirements. Through active listening and probing for the heart of the project you are trying to accomplish, we will be able to comprehensively understand your real requirements. Once your requirements are documented we will put together a plan that will get us to the finish line in a timely manner and within the desired budget. Whether developing a new automation process, upgrading a current automated system or solving standing issues, we work to satisfy all of your automation requirements. We recognize that when it comes to robotics and automation, there is rarely an "out of the box" solution. It is our goal to provide you with the flexibility a custom solution permits, and yet present a system that performs as reliably and as optimally as possible. Please feel free to contact us with your questions, issues or needs.
