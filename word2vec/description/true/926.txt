The CTP connects to existing security systems to analyse the underlying attack data. It prioritises cyber attacks by using a unique classification approach to determine the capability of the attacker, together with the relative sophistication and effectiveness of each attack. Machine learning is used to continually update and adapt the classification ruleset and provide highly accurate results. The CTP enables security teams to be more efficient by:
