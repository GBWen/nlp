Line-Up is powered by the first fully-automated event listings technology. This gives it the comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date event data available, with the ability to add new regions in a matter of days. Through a combination of machine learning and natural language processing, it extracts event data from venue websites. It powers 'What's on' guides for media organizations such as [Trinity Mirror](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trinity-mirror) and [Bauer Media](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bauer-media).
