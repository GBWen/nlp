We are Innotrieve, a new company founded in 2012 to make high value human resources information more accessible to recruiters, employees, and employers. Our company uses advanced artificial intelligence technology to comb public sources to discover information about people that other HR solutions dont find. We deliver data that creates efficiencies in your organization. Innotrieve was originally conceived in the research laboratories of InferLink Corporation, an AI data research company in southern California. With research funded by DARPA, NSF and the US Air Force, we were able to develop a proprietary engine for people discovery that will significantly improve the use of publicly available information from the internet, and other large data sources. Our products range from recruiting solutions to resume verification services to contracting and staffing support.
