"Savil.me will bridge the gap between traditional fashion brands and mens shopping habits. Men have different needs when they shop online. While they do not want to browse endless thumbnails of retail inventory, they still want to look put together. The Savil.me team has developed a unique data-driven system to present men with pre-picked styles and looks. Savil.me will go further by pairing these looks with lifestyle products and experiences in mens lives: travel, dating, work, sports, etc.
