Fynd.me presents a new way of shopping for fashion online by searching and not browsing. Users simply need to like a few products similar to what they have in mind and fynd.me figures out what characteristics they are looking for and shows them more similar items. To power this search, fynd.me uses machine learning to analyze each attribute of an item and builds a map of how they are all connected using these attributes.
