At SkyPhrase, our approach to natural language understanding is different because of our goals and because of our technology. We focus on giving people significantly more power over their data in specific areas, and allowing developers to easily add support to other areas. Within these areas, our technology can understand significantly more complex language with greater precision than any other technology. While we currently only cover web analytics and football statistics, our technology makes it extremely simple and easy for developers with little knowledge of linguistics or artificial intelligence to create natural language interfaces to their own data and applications. Our technology has been developed by scientists with decades of experience in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics research at institutions such as MIT, Stanford and Rensselaer. If you have a data set or API you would like to access with natural language, let us know.
