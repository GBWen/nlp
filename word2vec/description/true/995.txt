SP Robotic Works's unique and multi-faceted educational outreach initiative is the KIDOBOTIKZ, robotics for students from age 8 to 17. The idea of starting KIDOBOTIKZ germinated from the fact that Indian academic system predominantly focuses on theoretical classroom learning approach with little scope for the practical application of theory. Realizing the defect in the educational method during college days, does not give enough time for students to overcome it.
